1
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:05,843
Hey, Richard.

2
00:00:05,843 --> 00:00:07,069
Never mind.

3
00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:08,918
What do you mean, never mind? I called your name. 

4
00:00:08,918 --> 00:00:09,687
With a tone.

5
00:00:09,687 --> 00:00:10,879
All right, come on. 

6
00:00:11,565 --> 00:00:13,230
I'll give you voluntary. 

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,194
Make it involuntary, you have a deal. 

8
00:00:15,194 --> 00:00:16,327
I can't. 

9
00:00:16,762 --> 00:00:17,680
Richard. 

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,405
I've got marching orders. 

11
00:00:19,405 --> 00:00:20,871
Remember this thing was on tape. 

12
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:22,713
We've got public outcry to deal with. 

13
00:00:22,713 --> 00:00:24,885
Public outcry? The public is with her.

14
00:00:24,885 --> 00:00:28,529
Ellenor, I'm giving you manslaughter for a premeditated murder. 

15
00:00:28,942 --> 00:00:31,440
Why can't you ever take a gift and smile? 

16
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:41,948
It is a good deal, Sally. 

17
00:00:41,948 --> 00:00:45,967
They only possible defense we have is temporary insanity. 

18
00:00:45,967 --> 00:00:48,273
And because you don't want to say that you were insane...

19
00:00:48,273 --> 00:00:49,598
I wasn't. 

20
00:00:51,443 --> 00:00:55,149
Well, then I think that we should jump at manslaughter. 

21
00:00:57,963 --> 00:01:00,256
You will probably be sentenced to eight years. 

22
00:01:00,256 --> 00:01:03,892
And with any luck, you'd only have to serve three or four. 

23
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,513
Sally, you shot an unarmed man.

24
00:01:09,188 --> 00:01:11,424
If somebody raped and murdered my daughter, 

25
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,397
I might have done the same thing. 

26
00:01:13,397 --> 00:01:16,563
But the problem is you planed it. 

27
00:01:16,563 --> 00:01:19,691
If we go for a not guilty on the elements, 

28
00:01:20,673 --> 00:01:23,309
you could be going to prison for life. 

29
00:01:23,309 --> 00:01:25,430
Take the manslaughter. 

30
00:01:29,138 --> 00:01:30,418
No. 

31
00:01:30,418 --> 00:01:31,567
Sally. 

32
00:01:31,567 --> 00:01:32,797
No. 

33
00:01:37,858 --> 00:01:38,899
Ok. 

34
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,997
So the trial will start tomorrow. 

35
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:47,706
Guard. 

36
00:01:48,687 --> 00:01:51,777
Ok, we're gonna see you at the court house. 

37
00:02:00,934 --> 00:02:04,563
听写 时间轴：美溪客

38
00:02:47,752 --> 00:02:48,873
How could she not take it? 

39
00:02:48,873 --> 00:02:50,413
She doesn't want to serve three years...

40
00:02:50,413 --> 00:02:51,927
So she'll be serving life if she doesn't accept. 

41
00:02:51,927 --> 00:02:53,716
Bobby, I told her that, so did Jimmy.

42
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:55,143
She wants to try to beat it. 

43
00:02:55,143 --> 00:02:56,229
Did you tell her the odds?

44
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:57,200
Yes, we did.

45
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,782
So, what are you arguing? Insanity? 

46
00:02:58,782 --> 00:03:01,070
No, unfortunately, she doesn't want to do that either. 

47
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,217
Who is in charge here? 

48
00:03:02,217 --> 00:03:03,969
She is, she is the client, remember? 

49
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:05,931
And you're her lawyer which means you need to make her understand...

50
00:03:05,931 --> 00:03:07,314
Bobby, don't lecture me. 

51
00:03:07,314 --> 00:03:09,980
Judge Hiller is sitting, she won't let you argue nullification,

52
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,903
you know she won't. 

53
00:03:11,903 --> 00:03:14,770
Have we got a phychiatrist to say she was insane?

54
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,536
I got doctor Thibodeau stand by. 

55
00:03:16,536 --> 00:03:18,311
I'm telling you, she will not let us do it. 

56
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:21,219
Ellenor, this thing is all over the news. 

57
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:23,399
Which means if Sally Berg goes down on murder one, 

58
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:25,111
We'll be played for the idiots, not her. 

59
00:03:25,111 --> 00:03:26,846
Oh, so, this is about our ego? 

60
00:03:26,846 --> 00:03:30,192
Partly is. But it goes with her best interests. 

61
00:03:30,192 --> 00:03:32,639
You go back to her and make her see if she doesn't plead insanity...

62
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,568
We tried. 

63
00:03:33,568 --> 00:03:35,286
Try again. 

64
00:03:35,286 --> 00:03:38,408
If she refuses, file a motion to withdraw as counsel. 

65
00:03:38,408 --> 00:03:41,183
Bobby, this is just like our rabbi case,

66
00:03:41,183 --> 00:03:43,323
maybe we could argue moral duress again. 

67
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:46,028
No, Jimmy, because this time, we have judge Hiller. 

68
00:03:46,681 --> 00:03:47,999
Go back to the client, 

69
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:50,203
she either takes manslaugher, pleads insanity,  

70
00:03:50,203 --> 00:03:51,858
or we withdraw. 

71
00:04:01,554 --> 00:04:02,750
Hey, Sally. 

72
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,897
All right, listen, 

73
00:04:09,897 --> 00:04:11,843
As much as you oppose it on prinple, 

74
00:04:11,843 --> 00:04:14,204
we all agreed that if we're gonna go to trial, 

75
00:04:14,204 --> 00:04:17,022
we have to go with temporary insanity. 

76
00:04:17,022 --> 00:04:20,398
The only other choice we have 

77
00:04:20,398 --> 00:04:22,010
is jury nullification. 

78
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,695
And that judge will shut us down in a second. 

79
00:04:24,695 --> 00:04:29,087
But if we win on temporary, you could avoid prison altogether. 

80
00:04:29,087 --> 00:04:33,091
You have a chance, but you have to let us do our job. 

81
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:35,057
If we're to give you the best representation...

82
00:04:36,283 --> 00:04:37,524
What did she say? 

83
00:04:37,524 --> 00:04:38,729
She just called me a bitch. 

84
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:39,819
Look, 

85
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:41,767
I don't need you, and I don't need this case.

86
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:43,933
You could get life, I don't really care. 

87
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,166
He killed my baby. 

88
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:38,068
Let me do my job, let me do my job. 

89
00:05:55,978 --> 00:05:58,687
What? What's going on? 

90
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,999
We're pleading temporary insanity. 

91
00:06:13,282 --> 00:06:14,197
Richard. 

92
00:06:14,197 --> 00:06:15,082
Helen. 

93
00:06:15,082 --> 00:06:16,654
To what do I owe this? 

94
00:06:17,299 --> 00:06:20,215
Ah, well, actually, 

95
00:06:20,215 --> 00:06:22,929
I was just assigned second chair. 

96
00:06:22,929 --> 00:06:24,171
Excuse me? 

97
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:26,030
It's getting a lot of heat, so...

98
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,407
They put you on to, what, backstop me? 

99
00:06:29,315 --> 00:06:31,337
I asked to be put on it. 

100
00:06:31,337 --> 00:06:32,395
Why? 

101
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,370
Well, 

102
00:06:35,613 --> 00:06:39,011
Helen, what's going on? 

103
00:06:39,011 --> 00:06:41,571
What's going on is...

104
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:43,810
you're a little under review.

105
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,635
What do you mean I'm under review? 

106
00:06:45,635 --> 00:06:49,674
You've dropped some big trials and in addition to losing these cases, 

107
00:06:49,674 --> 00:06:51,849
you've also lost your poise. 

108
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:54,571
especially against Ellenor Frutt. 

109
00:06:54,571 --> 00:06:56,457
Richard, it's an election year. 

110
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,333
There could be some changes. 

111
00:06:59,078 --> 00:07:02,803
You don't want this one getting away from you, trust me. 

112
00:07:04,714 --> 00:07:07,879
So you...you asked to be put on

113
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,860
because I could lose my job? 

114
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,451
It hasn't come to that, 

115
00:07:12,152 --> 00:07:13,809
but we don't want it to. 

116
00:07:16,757 --> 00:07:18,797
There isn't a DA in this department 

117
00:07:18,797 --> 00:07:20,714
who goes in more prepared than I do 

118
00:07:20,714 --> 00:07:22,288
every single trial. 

119
00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:24,225
I know that. But...

120
00:07:24,225 --> 00:07:27,835
You've had some pretty high profile defeats and,

121
00:07:27,835 --> 00:07:30,776
you've been somewhat a loose canon. 

122
00:07:33,313 --> 00:07:37,483
Richard, let's just win this. 

123
00:07:46,268 --> 00:07:48,508
390 people? 

124
00:07:48,508 --> 00:07:49,444
It's not my fault. 

125
00:07:49,444 --> 00:07:53,102
You invited 390 people to our wedding? 

126
00:07:53,102 --> 00:07:54,146
I didn't invite them.

127
00:07:54,146 --> 00:07:56,231
The idiot at the stationary shop made the mistake.

128
00:07:56,231 --> 00:07:56,985
There were two lists.

129
00:07:56,985 --> 00:07:59,836
One was just the notice of our marriage after the wedding 

130
00:07:59,836 --> 00:08:01,759
She sent invitations to both lists!

131
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,651
What's going on? 

132
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:05,223
390 people got invited to our wedding.

133
00:08:05,223 --> 00:08:07,256
So what do we do now? Uninvite them? 

134
00:08:07,256 --> 00:08:09,695
Send out a notice, "Hey, we never meant to include you."

135
00:08:09,695 --> 00:08:11,053
It wasn't my fault! 

136
00:08:11,053 --> 00:08:12,503
Lindsay, you were in charge of this. 

137
00:08:12,503 --> 00:08:14,103
Only because you couldn't be bothered.

138
00:08:14,103 --> 00:08:16,283
I couldn't even get you to look at the invitations.

139
00:08:16,283 --> 00:08:17,133
Oh, this is my fault? 

140
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:18,067
Well it isn't mine. 

141
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:20,956
You want to get married, but I have to do all of the planning.

142
00:08:20,956 --> 00:08:22,733
Hey, if it were up to me, we'd elope. 

143
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:24,474
You know what, you plan it. 

144
00:08:24,474 --> 00:08:27,509
390 people, I don't even know 390 people! 

145
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:28,925
I think you both are acting out. 

146
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:29,663
Stay out of it. 

147
00:08:36,848 --> 00:08:39,084
We had just taken Mr. Whittier under custody. 

148
00:08:39,084 --> 00:08:40,028
Where was that? 

149
00:08:40,028 --> 00:08:41,383
At his own house.

150
00:08:41,383 --> 00:08:43,513
And as we were leaving the dwelling, 

151
00:08:43,513 --> 00:08:46,315
I observed Ms. Berg approached from acrossed the street. 

152
00:08:47,054 --> 00:08:48,493
What happened next, officer? 

153
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:51,336
My partner and both instructed her not to approach, 

154
00:08:51,336 --> 00:08:52,336
but she kept coming. 

155
00:08:52,336 --> 00:08:54,483
Then suddenly she's raising her gun, 

156
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:56,032
saying something about her daughter. 

157
00:08:56,032 --> 00:08:57,921
This woman right here? 

158
00:08:57,921 --> 00:08:59,099
Yes. 

159
00:08:59,099 --> 00:09:02,452
We then reached for our own weapons, but it was too late. 

160
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:05,840
Your honor, at this time, we'd like to play the videotape.

161
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,072
Go ahead, Mr. Bay. 

162
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:12,965
This arrest of course has been anticipated since early this morning when..

163
00:09:12,965 --> 00:09:15,738
Um, this is Michael Whittier,

164
00:09:15,738 --> 00:09:17,251
he is in custody. 

165
00:09:17,251 --> 00:09:18,743
You see him there in the middle,

166
00:09:18,743 --> 00:09:21,767
and he's apparently offering no resistence. 

167
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:23,325
Michael Whittier was...

168
00:09:23,485 --> 00:09:26,524
Ok, at this time I'd like to direct your attention 

169
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,456
to the right side of the screen.

170
00:09:28,456 --> 00:09:30,204
This happens pretty quickly. 

171
00:09:30,698 --> 00:09:36,339
again, a suspect in the rape and murder of seven-year-old Jessica Berg,

172
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:38,541
Rumors of his arrest have been in...

173
00:09:39,957 --> 00:09:41,336
He's been shot!

174
00:09:41,336 --> 00:09:43,354
Michael Whittier has just been shot. 

175
00:09:43,354 --> 00:09:44,423
Someone has fired. 

176
00:09:44,423 --> 00:09:46,233
I know I heard at least two shots. 

177
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:47,794
But he is down. 

178
00:09:47,794 --> 00:09:49,992
Michael Whittier has just been shot. 

179
00:09:49,992 --> 00:09:53,012
The police have the shooter, but I can't see...

180
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:55,369
He has been shot. 

181
00:09:58,178 --> 00:10:04,450
Officer Finlay, do you see in the courtroom the person who fired those shots? 

182
00:10:05,098 --> 00:10:07,350
It was the defendant.

183
00:10:15,103 --> 00:10:17,805
Bobby. I don't mean to be nosy, but

184
00:10:17,805 --> 00:10:20,126
You don't mean to be nosy? Since when? 

185
00:10:20,126 --> 00:10:22,668
Look. Obviously you two are fighting. 

186
00:10:22,668 --> 00:10:23,447
We're not fighting. 

187
00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:24,883
Well, she's fighting. 

188
00:10:24,883 --> 00:10:27,159
But you're just not involved enough to realize it.

189
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:30,065
Lucy, I think you should just stay out of things, is that possible? 

190
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,550
Foley depo. 

191
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,315
Thank you. 

192
00:10:33,315 --> 00:10:35,558
We go in for our marriage license today.

193
00:10:35,558 --> 00:10:37,328
Did you manage to remember that?

194
00:10:37,328 --> 00:10:38,183
Yes.

195
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:38,921
Good. 

196
00:10:39,797 --> 00:10:41,396
What is your problem? 

197
00:10:41,396 --> 00:10:42,835
Problem? I don't have a problem. 

198
00:10:42,835 --> 00:10:44,467
Look, Lindsay, you screwed up the invitations.

199
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:45,895
-Not me.-Maybe if I had a little help.

200
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:46,788
Here we go. 

201
00:10:46,788 --> 00:10:47,986
Don't "here we go" me. 

202
00:10:47,986 --> 00:10:49,978
I have had to do everything, Bobby. 

203
00:10:49,978 --> 00:10:51,219
You know, I had to make the lists

204
00:10:51,219 --> 00:10:53,028
First you complain that I was booking everything

205
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:54,907
I meant the church and your dead mother's dress.

206
00:10:54,907 --> 00:10:58,017
But when it comes to doing the real work, you just can't be bothered.

207
00:10:58,017 --> 00:10:59,614
Well, I'm bothered now. 

208
00:11:00,543 --> 00:11:02,904
I don't think you even want to be married. 

209
00:11:02,904 --> 00:11:03,805
Here we go!! 

210
00:11:03,805 --> 00:11:05,015
Don't "here we go" me!

211
00:11:05,015 --> 00:11:07,544
If you "here we go" me one more time I am going to scream, okay? 

212
00:11:07,544 --> 00:11:08,219
Do you hear me?

213
00:11:08,219 --> 00:11:09,141
Listen to yourself! 

214
00:11:09,141 --> 00:11:10,519
Ooh, and I hate that one too. Listen to yourself.

215
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:12,038
"Here we go" and "Listen to yourself".

216
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:15,459
If you ever say those in our marriage, I will scream!! Okay? 

217
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:17,548
It’s good to know these things before we become husband and wife.

218
00:11:17,548 --> 00:11:19,933
You know, this is very, very healthy!

219
00:11:21,186 --> 00:11:22,172
Bug off! 

220
00:11:24,932 --> 00:11:29,583
Well. It's nice to know you can make her scream. 

221
00:11:33,655 --> 00:11:36,032
As you can see, we were back far enough. 

222
00:11:36,748 --> 00:11:38,512
There she's getting out of her car. 

223
00:11:38,512 --> 00:11:40,655
She's got something in her coat. 

224
00:11:40,655 --> 00:11:42,838
She's moving across the street. 

225
00:11:42,838 --> 00:11:45,474
The police were all on the street, so there's no one stop her. 

226
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:47,526
Ok, here it comes. 

227
00:11:47,526 --> 00:11:50,306
She pulls up the weapon, bang, bang.

228
00:11:50,306 --> 00:11:52,940
She drops the weapon, and puts her hands up. 

229
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,383
And she's tackled by the officers. 

230
00:11:56,046 --> 00:11:58,059
That's pretty much it. 

231
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:07,746
What do you mean you can't tesitify? 

232
00:12:07,746 --> 00:12:10,479
Look, I didn't think she was insane to begin with. 

233
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,765
I was prepared to say she might have been. 

234
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,141
So, what's changed? 

235
00:12:14,141 --> 00:12:15,203
That tape I just saw. 

236
00:12:15,203 --> 00:12:16,308
I haven't seen it before. 

237
00:12:16,308 --> 00:12:18,923
And clearly, she is calm, composed. 

238
00:12:18,923 --> 00:12:20,631
That doesn't mean she wasn't in a rage. 

239
00:12:20,631 --> 00:12:21,393
Maybe she was, 

240
00:12:21,393 --> 00:12:24,861
but you're asking me to testify she couldn't distinguish right from wrong. 

241
00:12:24,861 --> 00:12:26,824
I can't say that. 

242
00:12:26,824 --> 00:12:28,472
She put her hands up over her head, 

243
00:12:28,472 --> 00:12:30,659
very calmly after she fired those shots. 

244
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:33,225
That tells me she expected to be arrested.

245
00:12:33,225 --> 00:12:35,819
It tells me she knew what she was doing was wrong. 

246
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:37,188
Oh, come on. 

247
00:12:37,188 --> 00:12:39,606
This defense was a stretch to begin with, Ellenor. 

248
00:12:39,606 --> 00:12:41,266
I can't stretch it that far. 

249
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:42,443
You have before. 

250
00:12:42,443 --> 00:12:44,216
No, I haven't, Eugene. 

251
00:12:44,216 --> 00:12:46,059
And certainly not on television. 

252
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:47,562
I have a professional reputation too, 

253
00:12:47,562 --> 00:12:48,615
you ever think about that? 

254
00:12:48,615 --> 00:12:50,252
Think about it, we're paying you for it. 

255
00:12:50,252 --> 00:12:52,035
We gave you 10000 dollars. 

256
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:53,255
I'll refund the money. 

257
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:55,106
You can't jump ship like this.

258
00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:57,337
I'm not about to commit perjury. 

259
00:12:57,337 --> 00:13:00,251
And if I testified I thought your client was temporary insane,

260
00:13:00,251 --> 00:13:01,843
I would be doing so. 

261
00:13:04,008 --> 00:13:07,660
If you don't testify, she could be facing life. 

262
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,625
Your client committed murder, Ellenor. 

263
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,365
You don't want to be introducing my opinion. 

264
00:13:20,941 --> 00:13:22,097
Now what? 

265
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,784
We got doctor Lanning. 

266
00:13:26,392 --> 00:13:27,844
Doctor dope? 

267
00:13:27,844 --> 00:13:29,850
At least he'll say what we want. 

268
00:13:30,752 --> 00:13:32,762
This is just great. 

269
00:13:39,122 --> 00:13:41,058
I think I should take her cross. 

270
00:13:41,597 --> 00:13:42,545
Why? 

271
00:13:42,545 --> 00:13:46,162
No offense, but I just think I'm able to come off more sympathetic than you. 

272
00:13:46,162 --> 00:13:47,781
You? Sympathetic? 

273
00:13:47,781 --> 00:13:50,904
Richard, it's a woman on trial, she lost her daughter. 

274
00:13:50,904 --> 00:13:54,576
I just think it makes more sense to have a woman cross her. 

275
00:13:55,182 --> 00:13:58,069
On the other side, I think I can go softer than you,

276
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:59,552
it's not your strength.

277
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,436
How close am I to losing my job, Helen? 

278
00:14:04,436 --> 00:14:06,478
I didn't say you were about to lose your job. 

279
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,374
Just the game, under review. 

280
00:14:09,077 --> 00:14:11,237
Let's just forget about ego, 

281
00:14:11,237 --> 00:14:14,388
let's just concentrate on getting this conviction. 

282
00:14:22,088 --> 00:14:23,639
And your social security? 

283
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,244
062-36-0749. 

284
00:14:29,152 --> 00:14:31,882
Okay. First marriage for both? 

285
00:14:31,882 --> 00:14:32,683
Yes. 

286
00:14:32,683 --> 00:14:33,670
Fine. 

287
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,539
And do we have copies of our blood tests?

288
00:14:43,172 --> 00:14:45,236
Uh, excellent. Okay. 

289
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,717
This is an AIDS education pamphlet

290
00:14:48,717 --> 00:14:51,099
which I'm required under Massachusetts law to give to you.

291
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:51,614
Fine. 

292
00:14:51,859 --> 00:14:54,035
Okay, I just need $25 in cash.

293
00:14:58,369 --> 00:14:59,371
Excellent.

294
00:14:59,371 --> 00:15:00,874
Okay, here you go.

295
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,346
Have a wonderful marriage. 

296
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,068
She had been missing for two days when I got the call from the police. 

297
00:15:12,068 --> 00:15:13,522
The call? 

298
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:17,030
They said they thought they'd found my daughter. 

299
00:15:17,604 --> 00:15:21,104
And they asked if I would go to the coroner's office

300
00:15:21,104 --> 00:15:22,711
to identify her. 

301
00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:23,821
And did you go? 

302
00:15:25,116 --> 00:15:26,381
Yes. 

303
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,568
They took me into a room, 

304
00:15:31,568 --> 00:15:33,770
and showed me her body. 

305
00:15:38,302 --> 00:15:39,921
And she was dead? 

306
00:15:41,304 --> 00:15:42,735
Yes. 

307
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:46,878
Did you make the identification? 

308
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,103
Yes. 

309
00:15:51,135 --> 00:15:53,425
Do you have any other children, Sally? 

310
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,275
No. 

311
00:15:55,275 --> 00:15:57,107
And Jessica's father? 

312
00:15:57,843 --> 00:15:59,666
He died three years ago. 

313
00:16:00,472 --> 00:16:03,057
At some point, you became aware 

314
00:16:03,057 --> 00:16:06,291
that Mr. Whittier was a suspect in Jessica's death? 

315
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,618
Yes. 

316
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:10,159
I saw it on the morning news. 

317
00:16:10,756 --> 00:16:13,677
That his psychiatrist had turned him in,

318
00:16:15,035 --> 00:16:17,133
and the police were planning to arrest him. 

319
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:20,091
Had you ever met Mr. Whittier before? 

320
00:16:22,062 --> 00:16:23,661
Yes. 

321
00:16:29,168 --> 00:16:32,279
He was Jessica's soccer coach. 

322
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,842
I would like for you to tell the court 

323
00:16:35,842 --> 00:16:37,894
what happened on that morning. 

324
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:42,225
I took my gun, 

325
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,941
I, drove to his house, 

326
00:16:46,652 --> 00:16:49,349
I saw that the police were already there. 

327
00:16:50,012 --> 00:16:54,220
I parked my car two houses away.

328
00:16:56,423 --> 00:16:57,805
And I waited. 

329
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,768
Waited for what? 

330
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,349
For him to come out. 

331
00:17:01,349 --> 00:17:02,120
Why? 

332
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,828
So I could kill him. 

333
00:17:07,957 --> 00:17:09,334
Can you tell the court 

334
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:12,290
what you were thinking when you approached him? 

335
00:17:17,382 --> 00:17:19,568
I was thinking about 

336
00:17:22,857 --> 00:17:24,604
about Jessica, 

337
00:17:29,046 --> 00:17:31,241
her last minutes. 

338
00:17:34,162 --> 00:17:40,005
how she probably couldn't understand why this was happening to her. 

339
00:17:44,619 --> 00:17:47,208
what was going through her mind

340
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:51,609
when his hands were around her throat. 

341
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,384
What was 

342
00:18:02,634 --> 00:18:05,288
when he was inside of her.

343
00:18:10,962 --> 00:18:12,642
She was only seven. 

344
00:18:12,763 --> 00:18:15,742
She was only seven. 

345
00:18:50,806 --> 00:18:53,264
Do you want to marry her or not? 

346
00:18:53,264 --> 00:18:54,978
Of course I want to marry her. 

347
00:18:56,332 --> 00:18:57,536
Then act like it! 

348
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:58,752
What have I done? 

349
00:18:58,752 --> 00:19:00,741
You're done nothing, Bobby.

350
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:01,966
That's the problem.

351
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:04,816
She shows you her dress, you hardly glance at it.

352
00:19:04,816 --> 00:19:06,550
The invitations you couldn't be bothered.

353
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:09,093
You've completely disengaged her. I don't blame her.

354
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:10,941
All that stuff is so trivial. 

355
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,385
It's a big deal to her!

356
00:19:14,123 --> 00:19:17,406
Bobby, this is the biggest day of her life.

357
00:19:18,103 --> 00:19:21,056
That should mean something to you. Does it?

358
00:19:21,056 --> 00:19:22,411
Of course it does. 

359
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,844
Then show her that. 

360
00:19:23,844 --> 00:19:26,118
We're in May, you got a June wedding,

361
00:19:26,118 --> 00:19:28,281
you haven't even picked out your best man yet.

362
00:19:28,281 --> 00:19:29,367
Look at me! 

363
00:19:31,061 --> 00:19:32,899
You're always on the hustle.

364
00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:35,359
Don't let your wedding day sneak up on you.

365
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:38,454
You're always dashing off to court, trying to get this guy free,

366
00:19:38,454 --> 00:19:39,738
trying to get that guy bail, 

367
00:19:39,738 --> 00:19:41,785
trying to overturn what happened to the other guy.

368
00:19:42,587 --> 00:19:45,159
Lindsay's your life.

369
00:19:46,005 --> 00:19:47,743
I know that. 

370
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,937
Show her that too. 

371
00:19:54,398 --> 00:19:57,233
How many days after your daughter's death

372
00:19:57,233 --> 00:20:01,259
did you see on the news that the police were about to make an arrest? 

373
00:20:01,933 --> 00:20:02,948
Three. 

374
00:20:02,948 --> 00:20:05,446
And after hearing this news, 

375
00:20:05,446 --> 00:20:07,614
you then retrieved your gun? 

376
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:09,801
Yes. 

377
00:20:09,801 --> 00:20:14,279
You then called your real estate broker and canceled your appointment? 

378
00:20:15,446 --> 00:20:16,508
Yes. 

379
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:19,148
And you drove to the suspect's house? 

380
00:20:19,148 --> 00:20:20,515
Yes. 

381
00:20:20,515 --> 00:20:23,656
And you decided to park at a neighbour's house

382
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:26,783
so you wouldn't be detected by the police? 

383
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:31,093
Yes. 

384
00:20:31,093 --> 00:20:33,760
Where did you keep your gun at home, Ms. Berg? 

385
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,607
In the safe. 

386
00:20:36,607 --> 00:20:38,166
Combination safe? 

387
00:20:38,782 --> 00:20:39,983
Yes. 

388
00:20:39,983 --> 00:20:41,642
Do you keep it loaded? 

389
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:45,593
No. I have to load it. 

390
00:20:45,593 --> 00:20:46,920
Thank you. 

391
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,172
Ms. Berg, 

392
00:20:50,011 --> 00:20:52,984
I'm deeply sorry for your loss.

393
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:57,468
You're here to put me in prison, Ms. Gamble. 

394
00:20:57,468 --> 00:21:00,408
Don't tell me how sorry you are, 

395
00:21:00,408 --> 00:21:03,201
unless you've had a child taken from you, 

396
00:21:03,201 --> 00:21:06,761
you can't begin to understand my loss. 

397
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:17,431
Ms. Frutt? 

398
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,882
The witness may step down. 

399
00:21:20,882 --> 00:21:22,945
Please call your next witness. 

400
00:21:27,956 --> 00:21:29,688
The defense rests. 

401
00:21:37,486 --> 00:21:39,201
Explain that to me. 

402
00:21:39,773 --> 00:21:40,798
I will. 

403
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:42,520
We don't even call an expert? 

404
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,234
Sally was our strongest witness,

405
00:21:44,234 --> 00:21:46,392
better to rest on her than doctor dope

406
00:21:46,392 --> 00:21:48,342
who Helen would have cleaned ** like a trout.

407
00:21:48,342 --> 00:21:50,792
We need somebody to say she was insane. 

408
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:51,302
No, we don't. 

409
00:21:51,302 --> 00:21:52,119
Yes, we do.

410
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,979
We have an affirmative defense, Eugene. 

411
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,842
We have a legal burden to prove it. 

412
00:21:55,842 --> 00:21:59,536
Ellenor, our case won't depend on proving Sally Berg is insane. 

413
00:21:59,536 --> 00:22:01,882
Everybody in the room knows she wasn't. 

414
00:22:01,882 --> 00:22:03,600
We know it, the prosecution knows it. 

415
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,546
So does the jury. 

416
00:22:04,546 --> 00:22:08,718
Our case is getting those 12 people to want to send her home. 

417
00:22:08,718 --> 00:22:12,070
And Sally's testimony is what we need to ring in their ears. 

418
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:16,714
Not doctor Lanning who goes from courthouse to courthouse collecting cashier's checks. 

419
00:22:16,714 --> 00:22:18,807
Our defense is emotion. 

420
00:22:18,807 --> 00:22:20,955
We rest on the highest note. 

421
00:22:21,554 --> 00:22:22,561
I agree. 

422
00:22:22,561 --> 00:22:24,118
You're forgeting Judge Hiller, 

423
00:22:24,118 --> 00:22:25,943
she is going to instruct. 

424
00:22:25,943 --> 00:22:28,280
If our case came down to doctor Lanning, we'd be dead. 

425
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,657
He is right, Ellenor. 

426
00:22:29,657 --> 00:22:32,451
Temporary insanity, we just arguing that with a wink. 

427
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:33,955
The jury knows it.

428
00:22:33,955 --> 00:22:36,857
If we try to fool them, we just lose credibility. 

429
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:38,397
Eugene is right. 

430
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,895
It's a big risk. 

431
00:22:45,503 --> 00:22:47,345
But we have to take it. 

432
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,279
You ready to close? 

433
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:55,256
Well, I guess I have to be. 

434
00:23:06,621 --> 00:23:11,116
That was very moving for me, getting the marriage license.

435
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:13,811
How was it for you?

436
00:23:17,623 --> 00:23:19,432
Why are we fighting?

437
00:23:19,992 --> 00:23:22,751
We always seem to fight when we talk about getting married. 

438
00:23:23,655 --> 00:23:24,388
Why? 

439
00:23:24,388 --> 00:23:25,388
I don't know.

440
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,118
Do you want to get married, Bobby?

441
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:32,374
Lindsay, I would marry you tonight.

442
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:37,936
I just hate weddings.

443
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:42,731
And I'd be lying if I said I was getting all excited about this ceremony.

444
00:23:42,731 --> 00:23:44,743
How can a person hate weddings? 

445
00:23:44,743 --> 00:23:48,999
Because it's all about the catering and the dresses and the flowers and 

446
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,778
who's invited and who's sitting at whose table.

447
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:55,230
It should be the most intimate moment of a couple's life.

448
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:58,082
And they spend the day making sure the guests are taken care of.

449
00:23:58,082 --> 00:24:02,249
There's so much pressure that everything go smoothly. 

450
00:24:02,249 --> 00:24:04,106
I hate weddings.

451
00:24:04,699 --> 00:24:06,123
There. I said it.

452
00:24:06,807 --> 00:24:12,835
But marriage, I can't wait for that.

453
00:24:17,224 --> 00:24:19,356
Would you really rather elope? 

454
00:24:19,356 --> 00:24:21,520
Truthfully, yes.

455
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,971
It would be you and me without all the distractions.

456
00:24:24,971 --> 00:24:26,989
But I know you want the big wedding day.

457
00:24:26,989 --> 00:24:27,588
And if that's your dream.

458
00:24:27,588 --> 00:24:29,019
I wish it were your dream. 

459
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:30,625
Lindsay, I've only had two dreams my whole life.

460
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:31,836
One was to pitch for the Red Sox,

461
00:24:31,836 --> 00:24:37,673
the other was to meet and marry the greatest woman in the whole world.

462
00:24:40,527 --> 00:24:42,365
One for two isn't bad.

463
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,997
Now, if I could just get you to take a little medication for your mood swings.

464
00:24:47,997 --> 00:24:49,119
Is that so?

465
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:51,127
Ow, ow, oh, okay, okay. Uncle! 

466
00:24:54,855 --> 00:24:58,043
I suppose we could pass a law 

467
00:24:59,132 --> 00:25:02,630
If you kill my child, I get to kill you. 

468
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:05,763
If you rape my child, I get to kill you. 

469
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:08,883
On a pure emotional level, 

470
00:25:09,643 --> 00:25:12,783
that doesn't really offend me, truth be told.

471
00:25:13,534 --> 00:25:15,028
On an emotional level, 

472
00:25:15,665 --> 00:25:19,923
I admit to take some satisfaction in Michael Whittier's death, 

473
00:25:19,923 --> 00:25:22,620
if he did what he was accused of. 

474
00:25:23,257 --> 00:25:27,183
I say if because I'm not sure yet. 

475
00:25:27,838 --> 00:25:31,664
Michael Whittier never got his day in court. 

476
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:36,055
He was executed before proving guilty. 

477
00:25:36,055 --> 00:25:39,426
None of us can take any satisfaction in that, 

478
00:25:39,426 --> 00:25:42,212
emotionally or intellectually. 

479
00:25:43,146 --> 00:25:45,638
One of the reasons we have laws 

480
00:25:45,638 --> 00:25:48,574
is to prevent people from going around with guns 

481
00:25:48,574 --> 00:25:51,368
being ruled by their emotions.

482
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:55,545
I sympathize with Sally Berg, 

483
00:25:55,545 --> 00:25:57,393
as I know you do. 

484
00:25:58,756 --> 00:26:03,015
But she wasn't acting out of insanity on that day. 

485
00:26:03,977 --> 00:26:07,817
She made a series of concious choices. 

486
00:26:09,108 --> 00:26:13,079
She had the steadiness in her hand to open a combination lock, 

487
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:15,207
to load a revolver, 

488
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:19,172
to drive a car through traffic without incident. 

489
00:26:19,743 --> 00:26:24,685
She had the presence of mind to park where she could  avoid police detection. 

490
00:26:24,685 --> 00:26:28,560
She had an understanding that what she did was illegal. 

491
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,731
That's indicated by her raising her hands in surrender 

492
00:26:31,731 --> 00:26:34,872
immediately after firing the shots. 

493
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,096
She willfully, deliberately 

494
00:26:39,581 --> 00:26:42,214
with malice aforethought, 

495
00:26:42,825 --> 00:26:46,044
committed a pre-meditated murder. 

496
00:26:46,044 --> 00:26:49,836
I don't think there is any doubt about that. 

497
00:26:50,505 --> 00:26:53,328
The only real question here is 

498
00:26:53,328 --> 00:26:58,290
whether you'll embrace her vigilantism by becoming vigilantes yourselves, 

499
00:26:58,888 --> 00:27:05,443
or you'll instead uphold the law you swore to uphold. 

500
00:27:06,081 --> 00:27:09,682
This is your trial now, ladies and gentlemen. 

501
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,674
This is your society. 

502
00:27:35,524 --> 00:27:37,625
I'm not a psychiatrist, 

503
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:40,323
and neither is Mr. Bay. 

504
00:27:40,323 --> 00:27:45,349
But I know of no medical opinions or studies 

505
00:27:45,349 --> 00:27:50,542
that say rage automatically makes you act wildly. 

506
00:27:51,274 --> 00:27:55,146
Sometimes if the rage is profound enough, 

507
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:59,262
I would've imagine it could take you over, 

508
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:05,751
to a point where you were even capable of cold  methodical vegence. 

509
00:28:06,378 --> 00:28:10,232
This is the kind of profound rage, 

510
00:28:10,232 --> 00:28:11,975
and grief, 

511
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:15,443
that took over Sally Berg. 

512
00:28:16,026 --> 00:28:21,322
I won't pretend to know what was going on inside her head. 

513
00:28:21,322 --> 00:28:25,631
I have never had a child raped and murdered. 

514
00:28:25,631 --> 00:28:32,973
And I would guess none of us here would presume to know such horror. 

515
00:28:45,011 --> 00:28:46,824
This is Jessica Berg. 

516
00:28:46,824 --> 00:28:51,496
She loved to collect and trade pokemon cards.

517
00:28:52,267 --> 00:28:55,516
She liked her stuffed animals more than her dolls. 

518
00:28:56,172 --> 00:28:57,824
She...

519
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:02,931
She loved to play soccer. 

520
00:29:08,118 --> 00:29:10,331
I would like to take a moment.

521
00:29:11,921 --> 00:29:15,956
And I would ask you to try and imagine 

522
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:20,191
the last few minutes of her life. 

523
00:29:59,406 --> 00:30:02,298
Imagine being her mother.  

524
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,231
You're going to elope? 

525
00:30:38,231 --> 00:30:40,891
Shhh, he'll hear you. 

526
00:30:41,723 --> 00:30:43,002
Well, isnt he going to be a part of it? 

527
00:30:44,349 --> 00:30:45,516
I'm gonna surprise him. 

528
00:30:45,516 --> 00:30:48,399
You're going to throw a surprise elopement? 

529
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,817
This is the best way to handle those 390 invitations.

530
00:30:50,817 --> 00:30:53,316
We elope, and tell people we're already married.

531
00:30:53,316 --> 00:30:56,776
Then we have a small ceremony later and invite the people that we really want.

532
00:30:57,027 --> 00:30:58,049
Tonight? 

533
00:30:58,049 --> 00:30:59,224
Tonight. 

534
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,450
Like in 3 hours from right now? 

535
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:02,714
Yes. 

536
00:31:04,082 --> 00:31:06,183
Oh, my God. 

537
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:07,367
Yeah. 

538
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:12,206
If I lose this trial because you cried...

539
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:13,709
They didn't see me cry. 

540
00:31:13,709 --> 00:31:15,074
So you cover your face, 

541
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:17,005
I doubt they'd thought you were trying to hide a pimple. 

542
00:31:17,005 --> 00:31:18,549
The problem isn't me crying.

543
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:21,420
The problem is there were tears in the jurors' eyes. 

544
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:29,230
Look, 

545
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,714
Ellenor said she'd still be willing to take involuntary. 

546
00:31:35,212 --> 00:31:37,028
I think we should give it to them. 

547
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,655
I thought they hate that upstairs. 

548
00:31:38,655 --> 00:31:40,929
If she walks, they'll hate that worse.  

549
00:31:41,331 --> 00:31:42,523
I'll talk to Scott. 

550
00:31:42,523 --> 00:31:43,399
No. 

551
00:31:44,285 --> 00:31:47,252
Helen, if we plead out on involuntary, 

552
00:31:47,252 --> 00:31:50,148
the perception upstaris would be I lost. 

553
00:31:50,148 --> 00:31:52,085
I need a guilty here. 

554
00:31:52,439 --> 00:31:55,102
This can't be about job security. 

555
00:31:55,102 --> 00:31:57,928
Easy for you. You're not under review. 

556
00:31:57,928 --> 00:31:58,809
Richard. 

557
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:02,982
She committed a first degree murder, Helen. 

558
00:32:02,982 --> 00:32:05,610
I don't want to give her involuntary. 

559
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:08,989
And I don't want to lose my job. 

560
00:32:23,665 --> 00:32:26,667
The judge is gonna keep them until 9:00 since it's Friday. 

561
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:29,080
And if they haven't decided by then, 

562
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,161
they're gonna suspend until Monday. 

563
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:37,762
Me too. 

564
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,393
Richard said no to involuntary. 

565
00:32:47,393 --> 00:32:48,442
Why? 

566
00:32:48,442 --> 00:32:49,605
Principle, I guess. 

567
00:32:49,605 --> 00:32:51,095
You can overrule him, Helen. 

568
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:52,596
It's his call. 

569
00:32:55,362 --> 00:32:58,506
Ellenor, can I talk to you in private for a second? 

570
00:33:06,092 --> 00:33:07,145
I just talked to Lindsay.

571
00:33:07,145 --> 00:33:09,348
She and Bobby are getting married tonight.

572
00:33:09,348 --> 00:33:10,512
What?! 

573
00:33:10,512 --> 00:33:12,650
She's surprising him with an elopement. 

574
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,783
Oh, men just love to be surprised like that. 

575
00:33:14,783 --> 00:33:15,649
Are you serious?

576
00:33:15,649 --> 00:33:17,859
Yes. She says she wants us to be there, 

577
00:33:17,859 --> 00:33:19,402
I said we could be here until 9.

578
00:33:19,402 --> 00:33:20,862
She's gonna try and hold the service, 

579
00:33:20,862 --> 00:33:22,978
but the priest's got a plane to catch.

580
00:33:22,978 --> 00:33:24,291
Is she pregnant? 

581
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:26,972
No. She says this is what he really wants.

582
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:28,490
She wants to surprise him.

583
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,204
Helen. 

584
00:33:29,204 --> 00:33:30,492
Ellenor. 

585
00:33:31,821 --> 00:33:33,342
Jury is back. 

586
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:57,378
Thank you. 

587
00:33:57,524 --> 00:34:00,641
The defendant will please rise. 

588
00:34:04,784 --> 00:34:08,394
Madam Foreperson, the jury has reached a unanimous verdict? 

589
00:34:08,394 --> 00:34:09,854
We have, your honor. 

590
00:34:09,854 --> 00:34:11,201
What say you? 

591
00:34:11,606 --> 00:34:14,408
Commonwealth vs. Sally Berg, 

592
00:34:14,408 --> 00:34:16,994
on the count of murder in the first degree, 

593
00:34:16,994 --> 00:34:20,120
we find the defendant not guilty. 

594
00:34:24,292 --> 00:34:27,042
on the count of murder in the second degree, 

595
00:34:27,042 --> 00:34:30,143
we find the defendant guilty. 

596
00:34:33,508 --> 00:34:36,609
Members of the jury, this completes your service.

597
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:40,127
Security, take the defendant into custody.

598
00:34:40,127 --> 00:34:41,975
We're adjourned. 

599
00:34:55,001 --> 00:34:56,308
Sally, 

600
00:34:56,971 --> 00:34:58,698
we're gonna appeal. 

601
00:34:59,104 --> 00:35:00,883
We'll appeal it. 

602
00:35:04,657 --> 00:35:06,671
It's a life sentence. 

603
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:10,550
We're gonna do everything that we can. 

604
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,183
I promise. 

605
00:35:15,984 --> 00:35:18,044
I promise. 

606
00:35:35,669 --> 00:35:37,796
All right. Enough is enough.

607
00:35:37,796 --> 00:35:39,835
What the hell's going on?

608
00:35:39,835 --> 00:35:40,988
Well, this is your bachelor party. 

609
00:35:40,988 --> 00:35:41,693
Bachelor party? 

610
00:35:41,693 --> 00:35:44,571
Rebecca, guys are supposed to throw bachelor parties.

611
00:35:44,571 --> 00:35:46,221
Yeah, well, we just wanted to make sure you got one.

612
00:35:46,221 --> 00:35:48,148
You know, sometimes weddings can just sneak up on you.

613
00:35:48,148 --> 00:35:51,050
And how sad would it be if you didn't actually get to have, OW!

614
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,035
What happened? 

615
00:35:52,035 --> 00:35:53,655
Rebecca just hit me. 

616
00:35:53,655 --> 00:35:54,957
Where am I? 

617
00:35:54,957 --> 00:35:56,251
All right, all right. Turn around.

618
00:35:56,881 --> 00:35:58,103
Should I give the signal? 

619
00:35:58,103 --> 00:35:58,940
No no no, not yet. 

620
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,420
What signal? 

621
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,032
Okay, take your blindfold off. 

622
00:36:02,698 --> 00:36:03,633
Now, Lucy!

623
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:14,556
What? I'm in Fenway Park? 

624
00:36:14,556 --> 00:36:15,924
Yes you are. 

625
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:18,196
But why? What am I doing here? 

626
00:36:18,196 --> 00:36:20,308
Well, you're doing what everybody does in Fenway Park. 

627
00:36:20,308 --> 00:36:21,478
You're eloping. 

628
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:23,579
Excuse me? 

629
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:25,379
You're eloping. 

630
00:36:32,346 --> 00:36:37,028
Oh my God. Oh my God.

631
00:36:47,308 --> 00:36:48,538
Is this for real?

632
00:36:49,648 --> 00:36:50,725
If you want it to be. 

633
00:36:53,206 --> 00:36:54,082
Hey, Bobby. 

634
00:36:54,743 --> 00:36:56,220
You can do this? 

635
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:59,385
I got special permission from the bishop. 

636
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:00,881
And it would be official? 

637
00:37:00,881 --> 00:37:02,180
Like Pearl Harbor. 

638
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:02,898
Quiet! 

639
00:37:04,949 --> 00:37:06,455
It would be official. 

640
00:37:07,227 --> 00:37:10,246
I figured we could have a more traditional ceremony a little later 

641
00:37:10,247 --> 00:37:11,689
with families and close friends.

642
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:15,211
But tonight, I thought you'd like to pitch for the Red Sox.

643
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:16,505
I'll catch.

644
00:37:18,297 --> 00:37:22,036
I don't mean to rush, but I have a 10:00 flight. 

645
00:37:22,036 --> 00:37:24,495
You're not rushing. I want you to do this right. 

646
00:37:25,047 --> 00:37:25,781
Are you sure? 

647
00:37:29,634 --> 00:37:30,768
Let's get married. 

648
00:37:31,946 --> 00:37:32,997
Hold on! 

649
00:37:32,997 --> 00:37:34,118
Did we miss it? 

650
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:35,556
You're about to. 

651
00:37:35,556 --> 00:37:37,584
Oh, God. I'm gonna cry.

652
00:37:37,584 --> 00:37:41,201
In addition to the flight, I'm getting old! Can we ? 

653
00:37:41,288 --> 00:37:44,286
Okay, ready. If you are. 

654
00:37:44,286 --> 00:37:45,886
I do. I am. 

655
00:37:45,886 --> 00:37:47,923
Look, they're on the scoreboard! 

656
00:37:48,178 --> 00:37:49,393
Please.

657
00:37:52,683 --> 00:37:53,343
Father.

658
00:37:53,343 --> 00:37:54,231
Okay.

659
00:37:55,456 --> 00:37:59,761
Now, this is obviously not a cathedral known for its happy endings.

660
00:37:59,761 --> 00:38:03,876
But Fenway park is certainly a symbol 

661
00:38:03,876 --> 00:38:10,518
of a deep life-long commitment of joy and of pain.

662
00:38:11,295 --> 00:38:11,943
Father

663
00:38:15,885 --> 00:38:17,152
I, Bobby

664
00:38:20,063 --> 00:38:21,039
I, Bobby

665
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:23,102
Take thee Lindsay

666
00:38:23,102 --> 00:38:24,968
Take thee Lindsay

667
00:38:24,968 --> 00:38:28,078
To be my wedded wife. To have and to hold

668
00:38:28,078 --> 00:38:32,975
To be my wedded wife. To have and to hold

669
00:38:32,975 --> 00:38:35,795
From this day forward, for better or for worse

670
00:38:35,795 --> 00:38:38,220
From this day forward, for better or for worse, 

671
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,519
for richer, for poorer, in sickness and health,

672
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:42,734
I've been memorizing this for a long time.

673
00:38:44,171 --> 00:38:48,303
To love and to cherish.

674
00:38:48,852 --> 00:38:55,293
Till death do us part. This is my solemn vow.

675
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,765
Well, I, Lindsay

676
00:39:04,313 --> 00:39:05,468
I, Lindsay

677
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,854
Uh, you haven't memorized this, have you? 

678
00:39:07,854 --> 00:39:08,871
I need a little help. 

679
00:39:08,871 --> 00:39:13,673
All right. Take thee Bobby to be my wedded husband

680
00:39:13,673 --> 00:39:16,240
Take thee Bobby to be my wedded husband

681
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,435
To have and to hold, from this day forward

682
00:39:18,435 --> 00:39:21,652
To have and to hold, from this day forward

683
00:39:21,652 --> 00:39:24,117
For better, for worse; for richer, for poorer

684
00:39:24,117 --> 00:39:28,029
For better, for worse; for richer, for poorer

685
00:39:28,029 --> 00:39:31,788
In sickness and in health, to love and to cherish

686
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:35,573
In sickness and in health, to love and to cherish

687
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:38,011
Till death do us part. 

688
00:39:38,011 --> 00:39:40,424
Till death do us part. 

689
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,134
Do you have the rings? 

690
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:47,111
Not yet.

691
00:39:47,111 --> 00:39:48,335
Oh. All right.

692
00:39:48,335 --> 00:39:53,147
Then by the power vested in me under the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 

693
00:39:53,147 --> 00:39:57,707
under God, and I suppose under the Boston Red Sox,

694
00:39:57,707 --> 00:40:01,090
I now pronounce you man and wife.

695
00:40:04,349 --> 00:40:06,489
I guess that means he's off the market now. 

696
00:40:19,021 --> 00:40:20,145
I love you. 

697
00:40:20,842 --> 00:40:22,441
Lindsay: I love you. 

698
00:40:22,441 --> 00:40:24,493
Do we all get to go on the honeymoon? 

699
00:40:24,493 --> 00:40:25,884
Uh, one toast.

700
00:40:26,692 --> 00:40:28,875
Thank you all for being here.

701
00:40:28,875 --> 00:40:31,592
Probably goes without saying, which is good because I never say it.

702
00:40:31,592 --> 00:40:37,308
But, you people are my best friends. 

703
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,240
You mean the world to me.

704
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:49,064
And this woman , she is my world.

705
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,817
And people shouldn't cry on baseball fields, let's go.
