1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,071
Can you draft up a motion to compel on Peters? 

2
00:00:03,071 --> 00:00:04,113
Documents? 

3
00:00:04,113 --> 00:00:04,803
Yeah. 

4
00:00:04,803 --> 00:00:05,705
Bobby, you ready? 

5
00:00:06,186 --> 00:00:07,166
Ready? 

6
00:00:07,166 --> 00:00:09,679
To go to the printers for the invitations? 

7
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:10,751
Oh God, I completely forgot! 

8
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:12,346
I got the Strauss depo at 10. 

9
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:13,693
Discovery's over on Peters? 

10
00:00:13,693 --> 00:00:14,666
But we still don't have the medicals. 

11
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:15,326
You promised! 

12
00:00:15,326 --> 00:00:16,199
Strauss, that jerk? 

13
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,203
That client. 

14
00:00:17,203 --> 00:00:17,941
I'm sorry. 

15
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:19,010
You should move for sanctions. 

16
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,012
I'll never get that... 

17
00:00:20,012 --> 00:00:20,666
You scheduled this depo intentionally. 

18
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:21,176
I didn't! 

19
00:00:21,176 --> 00:00:22,279
At least try. 

20
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:23,555
Can you at least look? 

21
00:00:24,853 --> 00:00:27,257
-Parchment with black ink or white with embossing?  -Yes on sanctioning, Bobby?

22
00:00:27,257 --> 00:00:28,332
-Uh... yes.   -The embossing is nice.

23
00:00:28,332 --> 00:00:29,277
I didn't ask you. 

24
00:00:30,738 --> 00:00:32,459
Bobby, you're going to be late. 

25
00:00:32,459 --> 00:00:33,362
Here's Strauss' address. 

26
00:00:33,362 --> 00:00:33,949
Bobby! 

27
00:00:33,949 --> 00:00:35,664
Uh... white with the gold border. 

28
00:00:35,664 --> 00:00:36,672
That wasn't one of the choices! 

29
00:00:36,672 --> 00:00:37,564
You asked my opinion. 

30
00:00:37,564 --> 00:00:38,543
Doesn't mean she wanted it... 

31
00:00:38,543 --> 00:00:39,638
White with the gold. 

32
00:00:39,793 --> 00:00:41,277
He didn't even look. 

33
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,724
They never give you sanctions. 

34
00:00:44,142 --> 00:00:45,973
You ever get sanctions? 

35
00:00:54,898 --> 00:00:55,771
Here's the keys. 

36
00:00:55,771 --> 00:00:56,873
That ain't gonna do it. 

37
00:00:56,873 --> 00:00:57,691
Here's my wallet... 

38
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:58,842
That ain't gonna do it, either. 

39
00:01:06,586 --> 00:01:08,692
Maybe you didn't see the gun, huh? 

40
00:01:08,692 --> 00:01:11,732
Take my watch.ATM card. 

41
00:01:11,732 --> 00:01:13,754
whatever, whatever you want. 

42
00:01:13,754 --> 00:01:15,765
I want you, Bobby Donnell. 

43
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:17,528
I came for you. 

44
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:23,107

时间轴：美溪客

46
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:06,211
Over there! 

47
00:02:08,864 --> 00:02:10,581
Look pal, I don't know what you want... 

48
00:02:10,581 --> 00:02:11,653
Sit down. 

49
00:02:13,182 --> 00:02:14,516
Sit your ass down! 

50
00:02:15,216 --> 00:02:16,873
Do me a favor too, okay? 

51
00:02:17,193 --> 00:02:18,734
Don't call me pal. 

52
00:02:19,212 --> 00:02:22,380
I want you to call me Mr. Rooney. Okay? 

53
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,538
Ain't that what the judge called me, huh? 

54
00:02:24,538 --> 00:02:25,373
Mr. Rooney? 

55
00:02:25,373 --> 00:02:28,189
Right before he dumped my ass in the hole for 12 years? 

56
00:02:29,292 --> 00:02:30,061
Rooney? 

57
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:34,363
Yeah. Rooney. Patrick Rooney. 

58
00:02:35,104 --> 00:02:36,734
Your old client. 

59
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:39,363
When? 

60
00:02:40,277 --> 00:02:44,394
1988. Braintree. Double homicide. 

61
00:02:46,006 --> 00:02:47,355
I didn't think you'd remember.

62
00:02:47,874 --> 00:02:49,152
Wait a second. Rooney. 

63
00:02:49,422 --> 00:02:51,342
I got you a deal, didn't I? 

64
00:02:52,186 --> 00:02:54,112
Yeah. You got rid of me. 

65
00:02:54,112 --> 00:02:55,326
That's what you did. 

66
00:02:55,326 --> 00:02:56,592
What are you talking about? 

67
00:02:56,592 --> 00:02:57,437
Shut up! 

68
00:02:59,798 --> 00:03:01,192
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. 

69
00:03:01,192 --> 00:03:04,690
Rooney. You had a trial! 

70
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,594
Some trial. 

71
00:03:05,594 --> 00:03:07,811
You were really good there, too. 

72
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:10,107
You sat there. You heard the evidence. 

73
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,919
You said yourself the jury was going to convict. 

74
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,435
I didn't force you to take any deal. 

75
00:03:13,435 --> 00:03:14,480
What are you talking about?

76
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,266
You told me it was this or life! 

77
00:03:20,246 --> 00:03:23,150
So I did 12 years for killings that I didn't do. 

78
00:03:31,226 --> 00:03:32,963
It's judgment day, Bob. 

79
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,441
Now you're on trial.

80
00:03:44,114 --> 00:03:45,990
I really hope I ordered enough invitations. 

81
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,607
250. Lindsay, 

82
00:03:48,607 --> 00:03:50,469
it's a wedding, not a Celtic game. 

83
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:52,722
I really don't think you should rush her. 

84
00:03:52,722 --> 00:03:54,048
Excuse me? 

85
00:03:54,048 --> 00:03:55,698
If you're not here to be helpful... 

86
00:03:55,698 --> 00:03:59,281
Y'know, maybe you should pretend like you have another customer. 

87
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:00,901
Aren't you the witch? 

88
00:04:00,901 --> 00:04:02,618
How many came to your wedding? 

89
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:04,114
I'm not married. 

90
00:04:04,114 --> 00:04:05,562
Big surprise. 

91
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:08,721
That's weird. 

92
00:04:08,721 --> 00:04:10,457
Hey, has anyone seen Bobby? 

93
00:04:10,457 --> 00:04:12,154
He hasn't shown up yet for the deposition. 

94
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,795
Well, maybe he got caught in traffic. 

95
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:18,313
He left over an hour ago and he was only going to Medford. 

96
00:04:25,827 --> 00:04:28,031
You want to tell me what your problem is or what? 

97
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,361
You're my problem! 

98
00:04:29,361 --> 00:04:33,148
That much I gather. Maybe you could be more specific. 

99
00:04:34,238 --> 00:04:37,134
Y'know, it would be poor judgment for you to get smug right now. 

100
00:04:39,187 --> 00:04:40,800
All right, look, 

101
00:04:42,105 --> 00:04:44,270
I'm sorry if you felt you didn't get a fair shake. 

102
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,303
It happens sometimes. 

103
00:04:45,303 --> 00:04:46,847
It's not a perfect system. 

104
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:48,124
Well, I got news for you. 

105
00:04:48,124 --> 00:04:50,608
It wasn't the system. It was you. 

106
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:51,965
You may want to think that, but...

107
00:04:51,965 --> 00:04:56,347
Hey, I just wanted to take the stand and tell my side of the story. 

108
00:04:56,347 --> 00:04:59,053
But you...you wouldn't let me. 

109
00:04:59,053 --> 00:05:00,397
I did that to protect you...

110
00:05:00,397 --> 00:05:01,588
To protect me? 

111
00:05:01,588 --> 00:05:03,507
Yes. You had a list of priors. 

112
00:05:03,507 --> 00:05:05,338
Doesn't mean I killed anyone. 

113
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,275
You take the stand, the priors come in. 

114
00:05:07,275 --> 00:05:09,215
I wasn't on trial for my priors! 

115
00:05:09,215 --> 00:05:10,567
That wouldn't have mattered to the jury. 

116
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:11,454
They just would've concluded that...

117
00:05:11,454 --> 00:05:15,146
The jury should've heard me say that I didn't kill anybody! 

118
00:05:15,146 --> 00:05:19,835
Instead, I sat there with my mouth shut on your advice, 

119
00:05:21,368 --> 00:05:22,961
and they made their own conclusions, 

120
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:24,063
didn't they, counsel?

121
00:05:33,728 --> 00:05:35,340
You know what really bothers me? 

122
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,882
You know what's really been eating at me? 

123
00:05:39,695 --> 00:05:42,727
You never even asked to hear my side of the story. 

124
00:05:43,686 --> 00:05:45,508
You didn't even want to listen. 

125
00:05:45,508 --> 00:05:47,100
There's a reason for that. 

126
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,296
Whatever you tell me as a client, I'm stuck with it. 

127
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:52,089
If I know you're about to lie on the stand, 

128
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:54,068
I have a duty to go to the judge and tell him. 

129
00:05:54,068 --> 00:05:58,727
It's better in some situations for the lawyer not to hear what happened! 

130
00:05:58,727 --> 00:06:03,310
Assuming that I would be lying. Which I wasn't. 

131
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,371
I was gonna tell the truth. 

132
00:06:05,371 --> 00:06:07,674
But you refused to believe me! 

133
00:06:09,343 --> 00:06:10,652
Okay, Patrick. 

134
00:06:12,825 --> 00:06:13,710
Okay.

135
00:06:16,662 --> 00:06:17,939
Tell me the story. 

136
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,210
I stayed in the car that night. 

137
00:06:23,686 --> 00:06:25,116
Mickey went inside. 

138
00:06:26,756 --> 00:06:28,862
I had no idea what he was going to do. 

139
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:31,627
I only drove him to his ex's 

140
00:06:31,627 --> 00:06:34,043
because he said he had some things to get back from her. 

141
00:06:34,043 --> 00:06:35,810
He told me he was going to talk to her. 

142
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:36,957
It'd just take a few minutes, 

143
00:06:36,957 --> 00:06:38,110
so I waited. 

144
00:06:39,157 --> 00:06:41,476
All of a sudden I heard shots going off. 

145
00:06:42,552 --> 00:06:46,002
I didn't even know Mickey had a piece on him that night. 

146
00:06:46,002 --> 00:06:46,779
But you ran...

147
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:47,905
I freaked! 

148
00:06:47,905 --> 00:06:50,917
I turned around, I seen Mickey come out covered in blood. 

149
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:52,263
I couldn't have any part of that, 

150
00:06:52,263 --> 00:06:53,491
so I took off, okay? 

151
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,541
Even if that were true, we had no way of proving it. 

152
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,108
Mickey didn't live long enough to back you. 

153
00:06:59,108 --> 00:07:00,664
Because the police killed him! 

154
00:07:00,664 --> 00:07:02,966
As I recall, they found your jacket next to the bodies 

155
00:07:02,966 --> 00:07:03,991
with the mother's blood all over it...

156
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:05,460
Mickey borrowed my coat! 

157
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,923
I'm telling you, I stayed in the car! 

158
00:07:08,923 --> 00:07:12,099
Okay, Patrick, I believe you. I believe you. 

159
00:07:15,347 --> 00:07:18,108
Don't play with me. You never believed me! 

160
00:07:27,061 --> 00:07:29,947
Bobby? Bobby, are you there? 

161
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,214
Bobby? 

162
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,128
Bobby? 

163
00:07:36,568 --> 00:07:37,796
Bobby.

164
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,262
What? 

165
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:44,246
I think he answered, but then it went dead. 

166
00:07:44,246 --> 00:07:45,331
Well, it probably didn't go through. 

167
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,461
No, no. Somebody answered. 

168
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:53,333
All right. 

169
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:57,432
This is wrong. 

170
00:07:57,432 --> 00:07:59,685
It's not "Mr. and Mrs. Robert Donnell". 

171
00:07:59,685 --> 00:08:03,498
It's supposed to read "Ms. Lindsay Dole and Mr. Robert Donnell" on the envelopes. 

172
00:08:04,707 --> 00:08:05,261
What? 

173
00:08:05,261 --> 00:08:06,396
You're sublimating. 

174
00:08:06,396 --> 00:08:07,522
I'm what? 

175
00:08:07,522 --> 00:08:09,763
You're taking it out on the envelopes, it's very common. 

176
00:08:09,763 --> 00:08:12,333
Things will go a lot smoother with your second marriage. 

177
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,878
I heat my pool on repeat business. 

178
00:08:14,878 --> 00:08:16,520
People actually come back to you? 

179
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,939
You're hurtful. 

180
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:20,788
And you wonder why you can't latch onto a husband. 

181
00:08:24,686 --> 00:08:25,577
Is that you or me? 

182
00:08:25,577 --> 00:08:27,115
-I got it.   -Drug dealers.

183
00:08:27,923 --> 00:08:30,851
Yeah? Ugh, no I haven't heard from him.

184
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:33,287
Did you try his cell phone? 

185
00:08:35,655 --> 00:08:36,964
That's strange. 

186
00:08:36,964 --> 00:08:38,748
Okay, I'm on my way. 

187
00:08:38,748 --> 00:08:39,576
What is it? 

188
00:08:39,576 --> 00:08:40,936
Bobby never showed up for his deposition, 

189
00:08:40,936 --> 00:08:42,173
and no one's heard from him. 

190
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,086
You're breathing pretty heavy, counsel.

191
00:08:46,086 --> 00:08:47,302
What's the matter, you scared? 

192
00:08:47,302 --> 00:08:48,418
Isn't that what you want? 

193
00:08:50,576 --> 00:08:53,551
I'd just hate to see this gun go off by accident. 

194
00:08:55,336 --> 00:08:56,912
That would be ironic, wouldn't it? 

195
00:08:57,859 --> 00:09:00,516
See, I'm having a hard time living with your mistake, 

196
00:09:00,516 --> 00:09:02,984
and you certainly couldn't live with mine. 

197
00:09:02,984 --> 00:09:05,562
Patrick, however angry you are, 

198
00:09:05,562 --> 00:09:06,862
you're free now. You're out. 

199
00:09:06,862 --> 00:09:08,347
Why throw that all away? 

200
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:13,622
Hey. It was all thrown away the day you were assigned to me. 

201
00:09:13,622 --> 00:09:14,361
Fine. So now what, 

202
00:09:14,361 --> 00:09:15,883
you're gonna kill me and go back to prison? 

203
00:09:15,883 --> 00:09:16,648
Your life will be over. 

204
00:09:16,648 --> 00:09:19,087
Let me tell you something, Bobby. 

205
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:23,824
The only thing that's kept me going is hate. 

206
00:09:24,784 --> 00:09:26,474
Knowing that if I just stuck it out, 

207
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:30,599
I would get the chance to have this very moment right here. 

208
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:35,343
That's the only thing I've had to cling to for the past 12 years. 

209
00:09:35,343 --> 00:09:38,077
Now that might not seem like much to most people. 

210
00:09:38,893 --> 00:09:42,659
But for me? To have the chance to kill you... 

211
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,991
If that were it, you would have done it. 

212
00:09:47,863 --> 00:09:48,869
Oh, it'll happen. 

213
00:09:49,512 --> 00:09:52,698
But first, you're gonna face the facts. 

214
00:09:52,698 --> 00:09:54,935
The facts that could've cleared me. 

215
00:09:54,935 --> 00:09:57,141
The facts that you ignored. 

216
00:09:57,141 --> 00:09:58,901
And then I'll kill you. 

217
00:10:00,274 --> 00:10:01,593
-Nobody at all?  -He's about 6'1", 

218
00:10:01,593 --> 00:10:03,458
-Maybe he came in with a head injury.  -dark brown hair, blue eyes. 

219
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,254
An amnesia thing. 

220
00:10:04,254 --> 00:10:06,314
-He could've come in as a John Doe.  -Yes, Donnell is the last name. 

221
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,016
-No?  -Yeah, sure, I'll hold again. 

222
00:10:08,016 --> 00:10:10,270
Ok, thanks. Nothing from Mass General. 

223
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,921
Ditto from Tufts New England. 

224
00:10:11,921 --> 00:10:14,959
And they're still saying his cell phone is out of range and not turned on. 

225
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,274
Any news? 

226
00:10:16,274 --> 00:10:18,298
Nothing. He hasn't shown up at a hospital. 

227
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:19,300
Did you call the police? 

228
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:19,868
Not yet. 

229
00:10:19,868 --> 00:10:20,418
Why not? 

230
00:10:20,418 --> 00:10:21,341
Lindsay, I'm on it. 

231
00:10:21,341 --> 00:10:22,589
Get Maguire. I'll talk to him. 

232
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,380
Excuse me, one second, ok?

233
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,258
Lindsay, I'm on the phone with Bobby's credit card company. 

234
00:10:27,258 --> 00:10:29,194
They're saying something about him buying electronics equipment. 

235
00:10:29,194 --> 00:10:31,017
DVD player, wide screen TV.. 

236
00:10:31,017 --> 00:10:32,515
Hello, this is Lindsay Dole 

237
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:33,611
I'm Mr. Donnell's fiancee.

238
00:10:33,611 --> 00:10:35,595
Is the person using Mr. Donnell's credit card 

239
00:10:35,595 --> 00:10:36,910
still at the electronics store? 

240
00:10:37,576 --> 00:10:38,863
Then get them to hold him. 

241
00:10:39,486 --> 00:10:40,194
What do you mean, you can't? 

242
00:10:40,194 --> 00:10:41,183
He's got his card! 

243
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:47,015
Look, this is Helen Gamble of the Suffolk County District Attorney's office. 

244
00:10:47,015 --> 00:10:48,838
I need you to talk to your manager. 

245
00:10:48,838 --> 00:10:52,051
Tell him to have security hold the man until the police... 

246
00:10:53,096 --> 00:10:54,815
I don't care what your policy is! 

247
00:10:54,815 --> 00:10:58,250
Do what I say or I will charge you with obstruction of justice. 

248
00:10:59,063 --> 00:11:00,734
Give me the number of the store. 

249
00:11:03,927 --> 00:11:07,696
Y'know, I can still remember the first time you came to see me in the lockup. 

250
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:12,553
You walked in real sharp. 

251
00:11:13,022 --> 00:11:18,487
I figured "Great. Some big Harvard type attorney. No problem." 

252
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,700
Did you go to Harvard, Bobby? 

253
00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:26,910
Hey. I asked you a question. 

254
00:11:28,263 --> 00:11:29,729
I went to Suffolk. 

255
00:11:29,729 --> 00:11:33,322
Suffolk? That's a race track. 

256
00:11:33,322 --> 00:11:34,453
Look, what the hell do you want from me? 

257
00:11:34,453 --> 00:11:35,496
I've been sitting here for three hours...

258
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:39,044
You son of a bitch! I'd kill you right now if I wasn't... 

259
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,190
What? If you weren't what? 

260
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,391
You just shut up. 

261
00:11:44,391 --> 00:11:46,635
You just shut your face and sit there! 

262
00:11:46,635 --> 00:11:48,006
You'll see what.

263
00:11:51,034 --> 00:11:54,007
I told ya, I told ya, and I told ya. 

264
00:11:54,007 --> 00:11:55,785
I lifted the cards from the guy's wallet. 

265
00:11:55,785 --> 00:11:56,803
It was just laying there. 

266
00:11:56,803 --> 00:11:57,473
Lying where? 

267
00:11:57,473 --> 00:12:00,399
Is this some kind of trick? I already said! 

268
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,069
Then tell us again, Mr. Franco. 

269
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:06,480
In the parking structure, on the ground, second level. 

270
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,710
And you didn't roll the guy?

271
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,895
You never saw Mr. Donnell at all? 

272
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,499
Come on, detective. 

273
00:12:11,499 --> 00:12:13,915
You got my record right there in front of you. 

274
00:12:13,915 --> 00:12:15,530
I boost and fence. 

275
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,488
Sometimes I kite a few checks, 

276
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:19,214
but I don't break heads! 

277
00:12:20,308 --> 00:12:23,107
I just took the guy's cards.

278
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:42,976
You don't live here, do you? 

279
00:12:42,976 --> 00:12:44,338
Yeah, I do. 

280
00:12:45,463 --> 00:12:47,266
Having trouble walking lately? 

281
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,415
That's my grandfather's. 

282
00:12:54,415 --> 00:12:56,780
Does he know what you're doing here?  

283
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:00,878
No. He died the week before I got out of jail. 

284
00:13:00,878 --> 00:13:03,081
Were you two close? 

285
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:05,317
Are we bonding now? 

286
00:13:12,705 --> 00:13:13,925
You stay right there. 

287
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,399
I got nothing to loose. 

288
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:03,227
Don't be jumping to any conclusions.

289
00:14:03,227 --> 00:14:04,751
This can be very misleading. 

290
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:06,730
Helen, we've been to crime scenes before. 

291
00:14:16,007 --> 00:14:17,496
You sure you want to be here? 

292
00:14:17,496 --> 00:14:19,031
I could take you back to the office. 

293
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:21,336
No. I'll be all right.  

294
00:14:26,637 --> 00:14:27,629
What do you got? 

295
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:28,650
Not much. 

296
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,502
Carjacking? 

297
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:30,173
Possible. 

298
00:14:30,173 --> 00:14:32,570
But most of those guys total the vehicle before they kick it back. 

299
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,015
And looking at the blood on the hood...

300
00:14:34,015 --> 00:14:36,290
I know. But I want the facts before I go there. 

301
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,308
We'll do a typing. 

302
00:14:38,973 --> 00:14:39,707
Mike.

303
00:14:39,707 --> 00:14:40,313
Hey, Eugene. 

304
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:41,238
Lindsay. 

305
00:14:41,674 --> 00:14:42,683
Do you have any witnesses? 

306
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:46,177
We're talking to people now, but I want to be realistic. 

307
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,801
Meaning what, exactly? 

308
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:50,200
They're not big on neighborhood watch in this part of town. 

309
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,253
Most of the guys down here... 

310
00:14:51,253 --> 00:14:54,037
They see a uniform, they think it's coming for them. 

311
00:14:54,037 --> 00:14:55,558
Do what you have to do to get answers. 

312
00:14:55,558 --> 00:14:57,057
I'll look the other way if I have to. 

313
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:03,456
Sit right there. 

314
00:15:04,747 --> 00:15:07,580
What's going on, Patrick? Who is he? 

315
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,118
You wanna know who he is? 

316
00:15:09,782 --> 00:15:11,243
Tell him who you are. 

317
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,788
Please, I don't know what this is all about.. 

318
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:13,439
Tell him! 

319
00:15:13,859 --> 00:15:15,925
Seymour Sternbach. 

320
00:15:15,925 --> 00:15:16,944
Look, if I did something, I...

321
00:15:16,944 --> 00:15:17,965
That's enough. 

322
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,313
I don't get it, Patrick. 

323
00:15:19,313 --> 00:15:20,741
What's going on? 

324
00:15:20,741 --> 00:15:22,376
Seymour Sternbach. 

325
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:27,309
What, that doesn't ring any bells to you, counsel? 

326
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:31,069
This is my exculpatory witness. 

327
00:15:31,069 --> 00:15:32,332
Your what? 

328
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:34,491
The man who could've cleared me! 

329
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:37,725
The man that you said you couldn't find. 

330
00:15:37,725 --> 00:15:41,388
The man that I found three days after I got out of prison! 

331
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:46,244
The man you never even bothered to look for. 

332
00:15:51,194 --> 00:15:51,890
Kidnapped? 

333
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,237
Yeah. That's what they think. 

334
00:15:53,237 --> 00:15:54,014
By who? 

335
00:15:54,014 --> 00:15:55,537
They haven't figured that part out yet. 

336
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,901
Random, or do they think he was the target? 

337
00:15:57,901 --> 00:15:58,901
I don't know, it could be either. 

338
00:15:58,901 --> 00:16:00,909
They really just don't know very much! 

339
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:02,187
Kidnapped? 

340
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,642
So, what, they expect us to get a ransom call? 

341
00:16:05,642 --> 00:16:06,892
Kidnapped for money? 

342
00:16:08,686 --> 00:16:09,954
I don't know. 

343
00:16:13,099 --> 00:16:14,327
I swear, I don't remember! 

344
00:16:14,327 --> 00:16:15,834
You're lying. You remember! 

345
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:16,555
I don't! 

346
00:16:17,307 --> 00:16:18,797
You were there, Seymour.  

347
00:16:19,831 --> 00:16:22,468
In a car, driving by, who would remember? 

348
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:29,764
I remember. We talked that night. 

349
00:16:29,764 --> 00:16:33,142
Yeah. You and me. We spoke. 

350
00:16:33,142 --> 00:16:36,416
You were looking for a parking space. 

351
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,529
I flagged you down, 

352
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:40,887
I told you I'd just be a minute, 

353
00:16:40,887 --> 00:16:42,798
I was only waiting for my buddy. 

354
00:16:42,798 --> 00:16:45,436
And then we talked about your red mustang. 

355
00:16:46,936 --> 00:16:49,420
Then you saw another space open up, 

356
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,109
so you took that one instead. 

357
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:53,650
Look, who's going to remember a two minute conversation 

358
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,360
over a parking spot 12 years ago? 

359
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,094
It was all over the news. The very next day. 

360
00:16:59,094 --> 00:17:01,291
A double homicide right where you were, 

361
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,585
and you're going to sit here and tell me you don't remember? 

362
00:17:03,585 --> 00:17:04,258
I don't!

363
00:17:05,444 --> 00:17:06,279
Patrick! 

364
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:07,520
Don't lie to me. 

365
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,709
Don't you lie to me. 

366
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:09,641
Patrick, you're gonna kill him!  

367
00:17:09,641 --> 00:17:12,023
Tell the truth. Tell the truth! 

368
00:17:12,023 --> 00:17:13,180
All right.

369
00:17:20,222 --> 00:17:21,068
Tell him. 

370
00:17:26,258 --> 00:17:27,335
I was there. 

371
00:17:28,842 --> 00:17:30,464
You remember talking to him? 

372
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:32,111
Yes.

373
00:17:33,121 --> 00:17:34,543
The night of the murder? 

374
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,175
Why didn't you come forward? 

375
00:17:37,175 --> 00:17:38,688
I was...

376
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:43,560
Look, I'm a married man. I met a girl.

377
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,199
-If I'd come forward, things would have been...  -Hey, hey.

378
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:49,924
I did 12 years. 

379
00:17:52,597 --> 00:17:55,449
You let me do 12 years because you were cheating on your wife? 

380
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,500
Hey, for all I know, 

381
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,631
you could've killed those people after we talked!

382
00:18:00,104 --> 00:18:01,047
Patrick! 

383
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,122
And you, you should've found him. 

384
00:18:06,122 --> 00:18:08,148
Even if we had found him, he doesn't get you off at all! 

385
00:18:08,148 --> 00:18:09,175
Yes he does!  

386
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:10,964
No! He just confirms that you were at the scene 

387
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,266
ready to drive the getaway car! 

388
00:18:12,266 --> 00:18:13,566
That's all the jury needs! 

389
00:18:13,566 --> 00:18:14,749
Only if I knew! 

390
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,743
I told you that I had no idea what the hell Mickey was gonna do. 

391
00:18:19,101 --> 00:18:20,198
Even so.. 

392
00:18:20,198 --> 00:18:23,165
Intent, counsel. Intent. 

393
00:18:23,165 --> 00:18:25,745
Look it up. I did. 

394
00:18:26,412 --> 00:18:27,873
Mens Reus. 

395
00:18:29,148 --> 00:18:30,284
If I didn't know what he was gonna do...

396
00:18:30,284 --> 00:18:32,194
But you helped him get away! 

397
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,479
He never got in the car!! 

398
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,284
But still, it was only your word! 

399
00:18:35,284 --> 00:18:38,902
Why would I flag a guy down if I was there to commit a crime? 

400
00:18:44,113 --> 00:18:46,006
Never thought about that, did you, counsel? 

401
00:18:54,247 --> 00:18:56,243
See that look on your face? 

402
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:01,023
That's the look of a guilty man. 

403
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:13,014
What about previous threats? 

404
00:19:13,014 --> 00:19:15,675
Did Bobby have any recent run-ins with clients 

405
00:19:15,675 --> 00:19:17,722
or witnesses that might have a vendetta? 

406
00:19:18,831 --> 00:19:20,273
We usually win. 

407
00:19:20,273 --> 00:19:24,060
No threats? No client you've screwed over? 

408
00:19:25,116 --> 00:19:28,080
What? I didn't screw anybody over. 

409
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,828
We may have got a break. 

410
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:30,281
What?

411
00:19:30,281 --> 00:19:31,921
Match on the prints from Bobby's car. 

412
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,292
Name's Rooney. Patrick Kevin Rooney. 

413
00:19:35,267 --> 00:19:36,543
Patrick Rooney... 

414
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:38,012
I think we had a client with that name, 

415
00:19:38,012 --> 00:19:38,732
but that was a long time ago. 

416
00:19:38,732 --> 00:19:41,285
Makes sense. He just finished 12 years at Cedar Junction. 

417
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:42,340
A manslaughter deal. 

418
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,997
I remember it because I'd just started working here. 

419
00:19:43,997 --> 00:19:45,161
I think he's from Southie. 

420
00:19:45,161 --> 00:19:46,566
We're going over his full history now, 

421
00:19:46,566 --> 00:19:48,028
but we'll need anything you still have. 

422
00:19:54,154 --> 00:19:57,521
Okay. Okay, maybe I should have found him. 

423
00:19:57,521 --> 00:20:01,102
You screwed up. You screwed up! 

424
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:06,854
And if I did? It's too late to change the past. 

425
00:20:07,612 --> 00:20:10,108
You want me to try and get the record expunged? 

426
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,886
You know what's been expunged? 

427
00:20:11,886 --> 00:20:13,660
The past 12 years of my life. 

428
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,609
Enough about the 12 years. 

429
00:20:15,609 --> 00:20:17,655
I've heard about the 12 years. 

430
00:20:17,655 --> 00:20:20,033
What about the 10 years before that? 

431
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:21,823
When you were out committing aggrevated assault 

432
00:20:21,823 --> 00:20:23,542
and knocking off liquor stores, 

433
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:25,443
the 10 years before that. 

434
00:20:26,686 --> 00:20:29,079
That's the reason why I didn't out you in the witness chair. 

435
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:31,277
The 10 years before that... 

436
00:20:31,277 --> 00:20:34,896
Was the reason you assumed that I was guilty! 

437
00:20:34,896 --> 00:20:36,882
Maybe it was and I'm to blame. 

438
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:37,787
But so are you. 

439
00:20:38,584 --> 00:20:41,161
Who you were went into my thinking. 

440
00:20:41,161 --> 00:20:42,508
What you were. 

441
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:45,428
You have to take some kind of responsibility for that! 

442
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:53,021
You sit tight. 

443
00:20:53,021 --> 00:20:54,626
Don't try anything cute. 

444
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:05,282
Hey. 

445
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:07,596
Okay, Patrick. You got five minutes. 

446
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,891
Why don't you come inside? 

447
00:21:09,891 --> 00:21:11,126
I'm serious, Patrick. 

448
00:21:11,126 --> 00:21:13,120
I told you on the phone I've got nothing else to say. 

449
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,488
**

450
00:21:15,488 --> 00:21:17,608
no, no, no! 

451
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:18,648
Patrick! 

452
00:21:22,201 --> 00:21:23,342
Listen, I'm sorry. 

453
00:21:24,055 --> 00:21:25,321
But I can't let you leave.

454
00:21:25,321 --> 00:21:26,856
Patrick... 

455
00:21:26,856 --> 00:21:28,921
Come on, come on. 

456
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,457
Oh my God! 

457
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:32,566
Come on, Suzie. 

458
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:34,766
-Patrick, no!   -Come on.

459
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:41,331
-Patrick, please..   -Sit. Sit down.

460
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:51,566
Listen. Hey. 

461
00:21:51,566 --> 00:21:54,643
Look,I don't want you to see me like this the first time, 

462
00:21:56,564 --> 00:21:58,282
but I don't have any choice now. 

463
00:21:58,282 --> 00:22:00,528
What are you talking about? 

464
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,149
I had to make you see. 

465
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:07,141
Because of them, I lost you. 

466
00:22:07,471 --> 00:22:08,850
I lost everything. 

467
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:09,762
What? 

468
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:12,932
They'll tell you I'm innocent. 

469
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:14,622
You tell her what happened. 

470
00:22:14,622 --> 00:22:16,206
He's... he's innocent. 

471
00:22:19,725 --> 00:22:23,620
Patrick, why are you doing this? 

472
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,697
Suzie, please. 

473
00:22:24,697 --> 00:22:26,676
I'm not going to hurt you, I promise. 

474
00:22:26,676 --> 00:22:29,960
Please. Stay right here, okay? 

475
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,562
Relax, okay? 

476
00:22:31,562 --> 00:22:33,552
I'm gonna get you something to drink. 

477
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:34,883
I'll get you some tonic, all right? 

478
00:22:34,883 --> 00:22:35,718
You want some chips? 

479
00:22:36,362 --> 00:22:40,221
You've got two men at gunpoint and you're offering me chips? 

480
00:22:40,221 --> 00:22:42,603
Come on, Patrick. Leave her out of this. 

481
00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:46,017
Leave her out of it? 

482
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:49,724
Leave her out of this?

483
00:22:49,724 --> 00:22:52,212
She is the reason you're here right now, 

484
00:22:52,212 --> 00:22:54,350
and she is the only reason you're still alive! 

485
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,475
You understand me? 

486
00:23:00,461 --> 00:23:01,818
It has to be here. 

487
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,753
Nice filing system you had, Bec. 

488
00:23:04,753 --> 00:23:07,217
Y'know, I don't see any dates on these folders. 

489
00:23:07,217 --> 00:23:07,563
Keep looking. 

490
00:23:07,563 --> 00:23:09,519
What exactly are we looking for again? 

491
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:10,648
Court docs, work products, 

492
00:23:10,648 --> 00:23:11,827
list of personal contacts, 

493
00:23:11,827 --> 00:23:13,903
anyone or anything that might help us. 

494
00:23:13,903 --> 00:23:15,467
We're going to be here all night. 

495
00:23:15,467 --> 00:23:17,377
I don't know why we're so shocked this happened. 

496
00:23:17,377 --> 00:23:18,600
The people we have as clients... 

497
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,500
All right, Ellenor. 

498
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,613
No, I'm serious, Eugene. 

499
00:23:20,613 --> 00:23:23,754
Clients always blame their lawyers, even in civil cases. 

500
00:23:23,754 --> 00:23:26,230
Our clients are murderers half the time going in. 

501
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,849
The bigger surprise is that it doesn't happen more often. 

502
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,089
I don't think she needed to hear that. 

503
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,130
I am sure he is okay. 

504
00:23:45,647 --> 00:23:47,431
You can't be sure of that. 

505
00:23:47,431 --> 00:23:48,842
I mean, who are we kidding? 

506
00:23:52,168 --> 00:23:55,514
If this is a revenge thing, 

507
00:23:55,514 --> 00:23:57,945
the likelihood is he's dead.

508
00:23:58,907 --> 00:24:00,040
We both know it. 

509
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,190
We don't know anything. 

510
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,921
This doesn't fit the typical...

511
00:24:02,921 --> 00:24:04,408
We haven't heard from him. 

512
00:24:04,408 --> 00:24:06,155
I mean, this Rooney guy? 

513
00:24:06,155 --> 00:24:08,461
I mean, why would he be taking him hostage? 

514
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:15,040
We both know the statistics, Helen. 

515
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:16,957
And the longer he's missing... 

516
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:18,836
We'll find him. 

517
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:21,610
I... I don't... 

518
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,638
I don't know if I can handle this, Helen.  

519
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:28,779
We'll find him. 

520
00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:29,743
Got it! 

521
00:24:35,582 --> 00:24:37,797
Rooney had us send a copy of his appelment papers 

522
00:24:37,797 --> 00:24:39,850
to his grandfather, Seamus Rooney. 

523
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:40,994
The address is right there. 

524
00:24:40,994 --> 00:24:42,877
All right, let's call Maguire. 

525
00:24:45,098 --> 00:24:47,827
I have two backup cars there right now and a couple on the way. 

526
00:24:47,827 --> 00:24:50,154
No one makes a move until we get there, understood? 

527
00:24:50,154 --> 00:24:51,336
Helen! I'm going with you. 

528
00:24:51,336 --> 00:24:52,268
We're all going. 

529
00:24:53,249 --> 00:24:54,295
Let's just go. 

530
00:25:00,563 --> 00:25:01,910
You want a drink, Suzie? 

531
00:25:08,447 --> 00:25:09,242
I got it. 

532
00:25:10,386 --> 00:25:11,481
I thought you knew. 

533
00:25:17,867 --> 00:25:19,319
Who was I kidding, huh? 

534
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:24,445
12 years, you don't come to see me once. 

535
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,448
I should've figured it out, huh? 

536
00:25:29,787 --> 00:25:31,591
I loved you, Patrick. 

537
00:25:33,853 --> 00:25:36,313
What kind of a future did I have with you? 

538
00:25:40,711 --> 00:25:42,296
Especially after... 

539
00:25:49,979 --> 00:25:51,347
You got kids? 

540
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,307
Two. 

541
00:25:55,896 --> 00:25:57,221
Pictures? 

542
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,601
Yeah. 

543
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:10,705
That's Jake. 

544
00:26:12,328 --> 00:26:13,770
He's 7.

545
00:26:13,996 --> 00:26:17,584
And that's Johnny. 

546
00:26:18,163 --> 00:26:19,382
He's 3.

547
00:26:21,553 --> 00:26:23,134
They're beautiful. 

548
00:26:25,545 --> 00:26:26,670
I...

549
00:26:30,816 --> 00:26:32,823
I wish you could've stuck by me. 

550
00:26:32,823 --> 00:26:35,809
Helped me through the trial. 

551
00:26:38,322 --> 00:26:40,427
We've known each other what, since seventh grade? 

552
00:26:42,421 --> 00:26:44,523
You don't even come to see me at the trail? 

553
00:26:44,523 --> 00:26:47,001
She was a character witness, Patrick. 

554
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,615
Her testimony wasn't important. 

555
00:26:50,615 --> 00:26:52,630
Hey, it was important to me! 

556
00:26:55,136 --> 00:26:56,510
She knew me. 

557
00:27:00,531 --> 00:27:03,427
I thought if I could make anyone understand it would have been you. 

558
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:09,099
Now look at her. 

559
00:27:10,741 --> 00:27:12,267
We were gonna get married. 

560
00:27:15,415 --> 00:27:18,507
Now she's afraid to even sit down and have a conversation with me. 

561
00:27:26,907 --> 00:27:28,906
This could have been my life. 

562
00:27:33,805 --> 00:27:37,695
Patrick Rooney! This is the Boston PD!! 

563
00:27:47,007 --> 00:27:49,130
No one will get hurt if you do as we say! 

564
00:27:52,131 --> 00:27:54,120
Hey, I got people in here! 

565
00:27:55,002 --> 00:27:56,751
That's him. Rooney. 

566
00:27:57,546 --> 00:27:59,665
Let's talk this out, Patrick. 

567
00:27:59,665 --> 00:28:01,449
Tell me what's going on. 

568
00:28:01,449 --> 00:28:03,184
Oh my God! 

569
00:28:05,748 --> 00:28:06,785
Are you okay? 

570
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:08,434
We're all right. 

571
00:28:08,434 --> 00:28:10,185
How many are you? 

572
00:28:10,185 --> 00:28:11,538
Three! 

573
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,824
Hold it right there. 

574
00:28:14,661 --> 00:28:16,447
I said get back!

575
00:28:17,828 --> 00:28:19,522
I'm not armed, Patrick. 

576
00:28:19,522 --> 00:28:20,529
See? 

577
00:28:21,011 --> 00:28:24,249
You heard me. Get back!  

578
00:28:24,249 --> 00:28:26,830
Come on, Patrick. I want to help you. 

579
00:28:27,401 --> 00:28:30,236
Tell me what you want, we'll work it out. 

580
00:28:30,236 --> 00:28:31,189
Talk to him. 

581
00:28:31,189 --> 00:28:32,392
You shut up. 

582
00:28:32,392 --> 00:28:34,733
It's not too late to end this all peacefully. 

583
00:28:34,733 --> 00:28:37,421
Come on, Patrick. You can get out of all this. 

584
00:28:37,421 --> 00:28:38,941
Tell him you want an offer. 

585
00:28:38,941 --> 00:28:40,505
What are you talking about? No! 

586
00:28:40,505 --> 00:28:42,261
Talk deal and we'll consider! 

587
00:28:42,261 --> 00:28:43,175
Bobby

588
00:28:43,175 --> 00:28:46,371
A deal! Give us something to work with! 

589
00:28:46,371 --> 00:28:48,029
You speaking for Rooney? 

590
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:50,021
-Yes!   -No! No! 

591
00:28:57,347 --> 00:28:59,173
Let's get the snipers in place. 

592
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:07,159
It's still unclear as to when the hostages were abducted. 

593
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:09,806
Our sources say it began in the morning. 

594
00:29:09,806 --> 00:29:13,685
We do know that the suspect's name is Patrick Kevin Rooney, 

595
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:16,594
released just three days ago from Cedar Junction, 

596
00:29:16,594 --> 00:29:19,620
after serving 12 years for a double homicide.

597
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,278
One of the hostages is Robert Donnell, 

598
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:26,800
the attorney of record who handled Mr. Rooney's murder trail 12 years ago. 

599
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,834
Yeah, mishandled is more like it. 

600
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:31,225
Patrick, you gotta decide what you wanna do here. 

601
00:29:31,225 --> 00:29:32,495
What do you want me to do?

602
00:29:33,392 --> 00:29:35,752
You want me to make a deal, huh, Bobby? 

603
00:29:35,752 --> 00:29:38,413
You want me to make a deal so you can go on with your life? 

604
00:29:38,413 --> 00:29:41,513
Not this time. No deals! 

605
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:44,108
Can't you see the man's trying to help you, Patrick?

606
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:48,576
Or what, you wanna die here in your grandfather's house? 

607
00:29:49,866 --> 00:29:51,642
Real nice for his memory. 

608
00:30:02,286 --> 00:30:03,770
You had a clear shot there, why didn't you take it? 

609
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,680
-We try to negotiate first before shooting him.  -Yeah, but how long do you plan...

610
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,756
Helen, please? 

611
00:30:07,618 --> 00:30:10,471
This isn't good. The guy isn't even making any demands. 

612
00:30:10,471 --> 00:30:11,337
Which means? 

613
00:30:11,337 --> 00:30:12,642
Which means he probably hasn't got a plan, 

614
00:30:12,642 --> 00:30:14,045
which means he's probably out of control. 

615
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,742
They should just take him out. 

616
00:30:15,935 --> 00:30:17,111
Well, let's hope they can.

617
00:30:22,456 --> 00:30:24,367
This wasn't supposed to happen. 

618
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,486
Not like this.

619
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:29,072
Patrick, are you listening to me? 

620
00:30:29,072 --> 00:30:32,565
Come out now and we'll work something out. I promise. 

621
00:30:32,565 --> 00:30:33,420
He promised! 

622
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,488
Shut up, you! 

623
00:30:35,089 --> 00:30:37,751
Patrick, your mission here, as I understand it, 

624
00:30:37,751 --> 00:30:41,134
was to show me and Suzie that you didn't do the crime. 

625
00:30:41,134 --> 00:30:43,663
To convince me that I screwed up by not believing you 

626
00:30:43,663 --> 00:30:44,615
and finding this witness. 

627
00:30:44,615 --> 00:30:45,877
You've done all this! 

628
00:30:46,607 --> 00:30:48,518
That was only half of my mission. 

629
00:30:48,518 --> 00:30:50,582
The other half was to kill you. 

630
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:52,063
Then do it! 

631
00:30:52,736 --> 00:30:54,154
And get it over with!

632
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,193
Fine.

633
00:30:55,193 --> 00:30:56,447
Don't antagonize him, for God's sake! 

634
00:30:56,447 --> 00:30:58,420
In which case the police will be charging in to shoot you! 

635
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,191
Stop it! 

636
00:31:01,849 --> 00:31:04,919
There is a way out. Let me talk to them. 

637
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:06,938
If I can get you out of this, Patrick, 

638
00:31:06,938 --> 00:31:09,369
let me try. Let me try. 

639
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,115
No. 

640
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:17,575
You don't want to die in here, Patrick. 

641
00:31:20,182 --> 00:31:21,992
You can't want to die. 

642
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,366
Patrick.

643
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:40,137
All right. Let's go. 

644
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,781
You stay where I can see you. 

645
00:31:45,033 --> 00:31:46,063
You hear me?

646
00:31:51,288 --> 00:31:53,412
Hold up, everybody. Hold up! 

647
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:54,434
Hold up.

648
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:00,961
We're ready to talk. 

649
00:32:01,531 --> 00:32:04,605
All right, Bobby. Go to the phone. 

650
00:32:04,605 --> 00:32:06,422
Not you, Mike. 

651
00:32:08,674 --> 00:32:10,392
Someone who can make good.

652
00:32:16,014 --> 00:32:18,844
Everyone goes free in exchange for charges dropped. 

653
00:32:18,844 --> 00:32:19,596
Bobby

654
00:32:19,596 --> 00:32:21,343
Helen, that's the way it's gotta be. 

655
00:32:21,343 --> 00:32:22,446
Can he hear us? 

656
00:32:24,118 --> 00:32:24,924
No. 

657
00:32:25,415 --> 00:32:27,230
That's the offer.

658
00:32:28,509 --> 00:32:29,167
All right. 

659
00:32:29,167 --> 00:32:32,614
Tell him to send out the hostages and we will drop all charges. 

660
00:32:32,614 --> 00:32:35,344
That won't work. You gotta do better than that. 

661
00:32:36,491 --> 00:32:37,363
Ugh. All right, all right. 

662
00:32:37,363 --> 00:32:38,899
Tell him we'll keep the parole violation. 

663
00:32:38,899 --> 00:32:40,024
Suspended sentence. 

664
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:41,081
Whatever. 

665
00:32:41,081 --> 00:32:41,886
You're not listening. 

666
00:32:41,886 --> 00:32:43,453
He isn't doing time! 

667
00:32:43,453 --> 00:32:46,345
We agree to no time or there's no deal. 

668
00:32:46,345 --> 00:32:48,805
The guy's got a gun, he's about to shoot me. 

669
00:32:49,796 --> 00:32:54,728
Okay, uh, I'm juts gonna keep talking so it looks like we're responding. 

670
00:32:54,728 --> 00:32:56,224
Uh, Lindsay's doing okay, 

671
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,733
we're all taking care of her. Bobby, 

672
00:32:57,733 --> 00:32:59,066
we'll get you out. 

673
00:32:59,066 --> 00:33:00,981
That's the only deal we're making. 

674
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,625
Okay. Here's the offer. 

675
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:12,911
They won't file on kidnaping, assault, or false imprisonment. 

676
00:33:12,911 --> 00:33:15,398
But the parole violation stands. 

677
00:33:15,398 --> 00:33:16,243
No. 

678
00:33:16,243 --> 00:33:17,974
Patrick, this is on the news. 

679
00:33:17,974 --> 00:33:20,752
They can't just tell the public they let you walk free! 

680
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:22,810
I have Helen Gamble's word 

681
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:25,196
she will agree to a suspended sentence on the parole violation, 

682
00:33:25,196 --> 00:33:26,944
so in essence, you will be walking free. 

683
00:33:26,944 --> 00:33:29,128
No judge is going to sign off on that! 

684
00:33:29,128 --> 00:33:32,377
The judge will go along if we can show you were wrongly accused. 

685
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,320
We'll need you for that. 

686
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,078
Fine. 

687
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,143
You can get out of all this, Patrick. 

688
00:33:39,969 --> 00:33:41,087
All of it.

689
00:33:41,087 --> 00:33:43,248
It's not too late. 

690
00:33:45,716 --> 00:33:47,103
It's not too late. 

691
00:33:49,216 --> 00:33:51,023
No. I want your life ruined. 

692
00:33:51,023 --> 00:33:54,055
I want your life ruined just like you ruined mine. 

693
00:33:54,055 --> 00:33:58,865
Patrick, you want the world to know that you're not a murderer. 

694
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:12,095
I won't go back to prison? 

695
00:34:13,827 --> 00:34:14,858
No. 

696
00:34:18,722 --> 00:34:20,156
You leave last. 

697
00:34:22,468 --> 00:34:25,629
We're told the police have made dialogue with the suspect 

698
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:29,313
and an arrangement may have been made to release the hostages. 

699
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,538
What is happening? 

700
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:34,674
I'm not sure. 

701
00:34:40,204 --> 00:34:41,253
Who's he? 

702
00:34:41,253 --> 00:34:42,627
I have no idea.

703
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:55,116
All right, Suzie. 

704
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:03,209
Bye. 

705
00:35:07,233 --> 00:35:08,615
I didn't do it. 

706
00:35:11,459 --> 00:35:12,907
I know, Patrick. 

707
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:15,928
I know.

708
00:35:20,149 --> 00:35:21,272
I'm sorry. 

709
00:35:25,975 --> 00:35:27,281
I'm sorry.

710
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:36,885
Maybe I'll meet your kids someday, huh? 

711
00:35:44,056 --> 00:35:45,384
All right. 

712
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,057
Get out of here. 

713
00:36:13,362 --> 00:36:14,650
You got a girl? 

714
00:36:17,726 --> 00:36:18,881
Engaged. 

715
00:36:21,157 --> 00:36:25,338
She's out there...scared to death.

716
00:36:28,297 --> 00:36:29,469
She's special, huh? 

717
00:36:32,465 --> 00:36:33,357
Yeah. 

718
00:36:38,509 --> 00:36:39,434
Look, I'm sorry. 

719
00:36:39,434 --> 00:36:41,156
I should've found that witness. 

720
00:36:45,281 --> 00:36:46,611
I'm sorry.

721
00:36:51,172 --> 00:36:56,023
You talked about the 10 years before. My priors. 

722
00:36:58,034 --> 00:36:59,678
The last two, I was clean. 

723
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:02,339
I was getting my life together. 

724
00:37:04,032 --> 00:37:06,799
Maybe I could've been a lawyer or something, who knows. 

725
00:37:07,203 --> 00:37:08,805
Any deal hold on,

726
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,557
It really wouldn't matter what the DA was offering in terms of a plea. 

727
00:37:13,557 --> 00:37:17,290
They could, in effect, promise the suspect anything under the sun 

728
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:19,769
and then vitiate the deal on grounds of duress. 

729
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:20,594
So what's interesting...

730
00:37:20,594 --> 00:37:22,016
What does vitiate mean? 

731
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:24,935
What the hell does vitiate mean?

732
00:37:29,771 --> 00:37:31,136
There's no deal, is there? 

733
00:37:34,734 --> 00:37:36,061
You've screwed me again. 

734
00:37:36,061 --> 00:37:37,374
The DA, she agreed...

735
00:37:39,412 --> 00:37:42,423
Is there a deal or not?! 

736
00:37:43,744 --> 00:37:44,966
There's a deal. 

737
00:37:47,587 --> 00:37:49,693
Bobby. Bobby!

738
00:37:50,131 --> 00:37:51,188
Get her out of here! 

739
00:37:53,031 --> 00:37:55,249
We can't tell exactly what's going on, 

740
00:37:55,249 --> 00:37:58,349
but we just heard the sound of gunfire coming from within the house, 

741
00:37:58,349 --> 00:38:02,396
where the gunman is still holding Bobby Donnell, the Boston attorney. 

742
00:38:02,912 --> 00:38:05,204
Sierra one, if you can get a shot. 

743
00:38:06,989 --> 00:38:07,918
Patrick! 

744
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,312
Patrick, if you could hear me...

745
00:38:15,322 --> 00:38:16,284
Dial the number. 

746
00:38:18,832 --> 00:38:20,802
Patrick, pick up the phone. 

747
00:38:22,544 --> 00:38:25,357
I need you to answer the phone! 

748
00:38:34,962 --> 00:38:37,390
Anybody does anything, and he dies! 

749
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,002
Patrick... 

750
00:38:38,002 --> 00:38:39,114
Shut up! 

751
00:38:40,382 --> 00:38:41,336
You hear me? 

752
00:38:41,336 --> 00:38:42,162
What do you want? 

753
00:38:42,162 --> 00:38:45,480
I want you to send in the DA. 

754
00:38:46,137 --> 00:38:47,475
And only her.

755
00:38:47,475 --> 00:38:48,899
Patrick, we can't! 

756
00:38:48,899 --> 00:38:52,391
I know she's out there. Send her in! 

757
00:38:52,391 --> 00:38:54,016
You got a shot? 

758
00:38:54,622 --> 00:38:55,633
Barely. 

759
00:38:57,328 --> 00:39:01,020
Patrick, release Mr. Donnell and we'll send in the DA. 

760
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,433
No. No way. 

761
00:39:02,433 --> 00:39:04,069
Patrick, please! 

762
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:07,272
You send her in right now, or he dies! 

763
00:39:07,272 --> 00:39:09,069
If you release Mr. Donnell...

764
00:39:09,069 --> 00:39:11,774
He dies on the count of 3. 

765
00:39:11,774 --> 00:39:13,322
Do you understand me?

766
00:39:13,322 --> 00:39:14,111
Let me go. 

767
00:39:14,111 --> 00:39:15,411
-Not a chance.  -One.

768
00:39:15,411 --> 00:39:16,533
Patrick!  

769
00:39:17,718 --> 00:39:18,784
Two. 

770
00:39:19,053 --> 00:39:20,037
Take him. 

771
00:40:05,512 --> 00:40:07,740
One single gunshot wound to the head, 

772
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,998
Mr. Rooney went down immediately. 

773
00:40:09,998 --> 00:40:13,344
The hostage, Robert Donnell, was unhurt. 

774
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:16,758
Patrick Kevin Rooney was pronounced dead on the scene.

775
00:40:16,758 --> 00:40:21,483
Police homicide detective Mike Maguire spoke later about the incident. 

776
00:40:37,466 --> 00:40:39,477
I did screw up his case. 

777
00:40:40,409 --> 00:40:41,033
Bobby... 

778
00:40:41,033 --> 00:40:42,386
I was right out of school. 

779
00:40:43,982 --> 00:40:47,747
Taking three assignments a clip, 17 hours a day, 

780
00:40:47,747 --> 00:40:49,362
trying to scratch. 

781
00:40:51,757 --> 00:40:53,507
I trusted the DAs then. 

782
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:57,055
If they told me he was guilty, I believed them. 

783
00:41:00,353 --> 00:41:02,673
I probably did push that deal on him 

784
00:41:02,673 --> 00:41:05,066
without even bothering to track down the witness. 

785
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,613
Took one look at his rap sheet and 

786
00:41:11,089 --> 00:41:12,369
prejudged him.

787
00:41:15,561 --> 00:41:17,021
And I doubt...

788
00:41:17,321 --> 00:41:19,589
I doubt it was the only time.

789
00:41:26,294 --> 00:41:27,955
I thought I'd lost you. 

790
00:41:30,711 --> 00:41:33,738
The whole time, all I could see was your face. 

791
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,735
It's over. 

792
00:41:42,648 --> 00:41:44,542
Your face. 

793
00:41:53,108 --> 00:41:55,162
And all I can see now...

794
00:41:58,162 --> 00:41:59,574
is his.
