1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,095
Previous on The Practice:

2
00:00:02,095 --> 00:00:04,786
Can you tell me the crime your son’s been convicted of?

3
00:00:04,786 --> 00:00:06,772
He’s on death row in Pennsylvania.

4
00:00:06,772 --> 00:00:08,922
He’s to be executed in five weeks.

5
00:00:08,922 --> 00:00:12,722
He’s convicted of raping and killing his girlfriend, Alisha Kerns, 

6
00:00:12,722 --> 00:00:13,877
then killing her mother.

7
00:00:13,877 --> 00:00:15,014
Any DNA?

8
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:17,835
They didn’t do full DNA analysis back then.

9
00:00:17,835 --> 00:00:19,756
This is Ellenor Frutt.

10
00:00:19,756 --> 00:00:20,360
Hello.

11
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,558
She says you can do something, can you really?

12
00:00:22,558 --> 00:00:25,841
We are trying to get the DNA test in order to prove that he’s innocent 

13
00:00:25,841 --> 00:00:29,402
but we can’t get that test unless we prove that he’s innocent first?

14
00:00:29,402 --> 00:00:30,076
Right.

15
00:00:30,076 --> 00:00:31,208
How the hell can that be?

16
00:00:31,796 --> 00:00:33,433
Can you think of anybody else

17
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,849
who may have wanna harm your daughter or your wife?

18
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:38,788
They got the real killer, Mr. Berluti.

19
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:42,342
Your testimony was especially powerful, you said that he confessed to you.

20
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:43,082
What do you want from me?

21
00:00:43,082 --> 00:00:46,059
A statement saying that you lied, that he never confessed.

22
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:49,031
You can be sure it was Stuart Donavan you saw going to the house?

23
00:00:49,031 --> 00:00:51,401
It was between 11:30 and 12.

24
00:00:51,401 --> 00:00:53,411
My husband was a drunk back then.

25
00:00:53,411 --> 00:00:57,002
He could’ve believed it was 11:30 when it may have been 9.

26
00:00:57,761 --> 00:00:59,958
Well, we feel the jury in this case, 

27
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:01,964
given all these new information 

28
00:01:01,964 --> 00:01:05,589
quite likely would have returned with a verdict of not guilty.

29
00:01:05,589 --> 00:01:06,942
We are not persuaded that 

30
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:11,582
they could not have reasonably returned with the guilty just the same.

31
00:01:11,582 --> 00:01:15,778
The petitioner’s request for a DNA test is therefore denied.

32
00:01:15,778 --> 00:01:17,647
We are adjourned.

33
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:22,046
You’ve got to be kidding. 

34
00:01:22,046 --> 00:01:23,607
This is a matter of life and death.

35
00:01:23,607 --> 00:01:25,632
I am sorry, without an appointment there is really not …

36
00:01:25,632 --> 00:01:27,694
I have been trying to make an appointment.

37
00:01:27,694 --> 00:01:30,653
You offered me one of two days in July, 

38
00:01:30,653 --> 00:01:33,164
by that time Stuart Donovan will be dead.

39
00:01:33,164 --> 00:01:35,900
Ms. Frutt, the Governor did consider your request, 

40
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,399
and as far as…

41
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:38,940
I don’t mean to be rude. But I don’t believe he did.

42
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,414
Because from everything I’ve read about him 

43
00:01:40,414 --> 00:01:43,542
he is not only intelligent but he is extremely fair minded.

44
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:45,930
And there is no way he would’ve denied this reprieve

45
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,782
had he considered the facts of…

46
00:01:47,782 --> 00:01:49,398
I assure you he did.

47
00:01:49,398 --> 00:01:50,543
I’d like to hear from him.

48
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:52,948
Ms. Mathers, I am asking for 30 seconds’ of his time 

49
00:01:52,948 --> 00:01:55,311
and after that you can have me escorted out.

50
00:01:55,311 --> 00:01:57,388
How would this administration run, Ms. Frutt, 

51
00:01:57,388 --> 00:01:59,985
if we were to give 30 seconds to every attorney 

52
00:01:59,985 --> 00:02:02,754
who marched in here looking to stay an execution.

53
00:02:03,558 --> 00:02:05,985
Actually I think it would run just fine. 

54
00:02:05,985 --> 00:02:08,745
This is the second execution in four years.

55
00:02:08,745 --> 00:02:12,231
One minutes in four years isn’t likely to cripple his administration.

56
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:14,599
I am afraid I have to ask you to leave.

57
00:02:16,589 --> 00:02:19,007
Could you give him this note?

58
00:02:19,007 --> 00:02:20,945
I am afraid I can’t, I am sorry.

59
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:24,060
Could you pass on a gesture?

60
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,894
Your 30 seconds with me are up.

61
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:34,418
Since 1985, nation wild, 

62
00:02:34,418 --> 00:02:38,299
there have been at least 10 botched executions by lethal injection.

63
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:41,078
Mr. Berluti, what is the basis of this petition?

64
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,453
That to subject my client to lethal injection 

65
00:02:43,453 --> 00:02:45,458
would have amount to cruel and unusual punishment 

66
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:46,731
given the likelihood that the…

67
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:49,631
Counsel, for us to order that DNA test 

68
00:02:49,631 --> 00:02:54,194
you have to show that a reasonable jury couldn't have found your client guilty.

69
00:02:54,194 --> 00:02:56,521
We went through all that last week. 

70
00:02:56,721 --> 00:03:00,431
We turned you down, what’s changed in the last nine days?

71
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:03,375
Well, Your Honour, I thought perhaps the court turned us down 

72
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,929
mainly on the constitutional grounds.

73
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:10,141
That’s why we’ve come back today with stronger constitutional grounds 

74
00:03:10,141 --> 00:03:12,169
that being the eighth amendment: 

75
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:13,972
cruel and unusual punishment.

76
00:03:13,972 --> 00:03:19,331
The petition is denied and defence counsel is fined a thousand dollars.

77
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:20,628
We are adjourned.

78
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:23,640
Wait a second, 

79
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,753
we are trying to save an innocent man from being put to death, 

80
00:03:26,753 --> 00:03:29,033
and you are fining me now a thousand dollars?

81
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:30,536
I am, sir. 

82
00:03:30,536 --> 00:03:33,061
You’re here with nothing new.

83
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:36,547
Taking up the time of a District Attorney, three federal judges 

84
00:03:36,547 --> 00:03:39,244
not to mention all the court employees.

85
00:03:39,244 --> 00:03:42,616
And the fine is going up to 1500 if you say another word.

86
00:03:42,616 --> 00:03:44,708
Suppose the tubes close like they have in the past, 

87
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,947
I am not entitled to be concerned about that?

88
00:03:46,947 --> 00:03:51,307
The court will allow, counsel, to inspect the execution as the equipment.

89
00:03:51,307 --> 00:03:54,478
The fine is now 1500.

90
00:03:59,042 --> 00:04:03,106
听写：诸如 

91
00:04:04,317 --> 00:04:08,355
时间轴：美溪客

92
00:04:49,688 --> 00:04:51,474
Okay, great, thank you.

93
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:57,918
Okay, Lucy, Joe Bullock, prisoner informant, 

94
00:04:57,918 --> 00:04:59,774
supposedly Earl Taylor’s mentor, 

95
00:04:59,774 --> 00:05:01,350
he told him everything he knows.

96
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,497
I’d like you to go and see if you could find out 

97
00:05:03,497 --> 00:05:05,509
how Earl learned the details of crime.

98
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:07,139
You want me to meet with him?

99
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,869
Evidently he has a thing for young girls.

100
00:05:09,869 --> 00:05:10,792
Forget it.

101
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:12,801
You will be separated by a partition. 

102
00:05:12,801 --> 00:05:14,402
You just have to go and talk to him.

103
00:05:14,402 --> 00:05:15,612
Do I have to?

104
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,642
No. 

105
00:05:18,711 --> 00:05:21,076
But you might be our best shot.

106
00:05:21,076 --> 00:05:23,168
The clothes.

107
00:05:23,168 --> 00:05:24,813
Excuse me.

108
00:05:24,813 --> 00:05:28,745
Alisha Kerns was raped and killed while wearing a night shirt.

109
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,676
So?

110
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:33,085
So there is nothing in here about it ever being tested, 

111
00:05:33,085 --> 00:05:36,172
all the semen was came from the rape kit’s swab.

112
00:05:36,172 --> 00:05:37,206
So what?

113
00:05:37,206 --> 00:05:39,315
Well, the rape kit was introduced to trial 

114
00:05:39,315 --> 00:05:41,016
that’s why they say it's not new evidence.

115
00:05:41,016 --> 00:05:43,323
The night shirt, that was never introduced, 

116
00:05:43,323 --> 00:05:46,086
we can make the argument that would be new evidence.

117
00:05:46,086 --> 00:05:48,245
It was never tested, maybe there is something on it.

118
00:05:49,127 --> 00:05:51,191
Where would the night shirt be?

119
00:05:59,574 --> 00:06:02,143
She probably went to the coroner with it.

120
00:06:11,761 --> 00:06:13,731
We sent it to the mortuary.

121
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:14,683
The night shirt.

122
00:06:14,683 --> 00:06:16,973
That’s what it says: 

123
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:22,356
the father of the victim requested that we sent it along with the body to the mortuary.

124
00:06:22,356 --> 00:06:24,283
Why the hell would he request that?

125
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:29,784
Kerns, he must be Jewish.

126
00:06:30,611 --> 00:06:31,402
What?

127
00:06:31,402 --> 00:06:31,911
Yeah.

128
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:34,527
It’s an ancient Jewish custom, 

129
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:39,055
let the victim of a violent crime be buried in the clothes they died in.

130
00:06:39,055 --> 00:06:43,689
It’s thought to arouse compassion in god and hasten the end of the exile.

131
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,759
Really?

132
00:06:46,756 --> 00:06:50,743
She was buried in the night shirt, it’s in the coffin.

133
00:07:13,236 --> 00:07:16,025
What are you? 15?

134
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:17,431
If you could help me, sir, 
 
135
00:07:17,431 --> 00:07:20,737
Stuart Donovan is scheduled for execution the day after tomorrow…

136
00:07:20,737 --> 00:07:22,845
Show me a little something before we get started.

137
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,171
I am not gonna flash you.

138
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:31,073
I am told that you know how Earl Taylor got the details on Stuart Donovan’s case.

139
00:07:31,073 --> 00:07:32,341
Show me one of your tity.

140
00:07:32,341 --> 00:07:33,445
Mr. Bullock, I am here ask…

141
00:07:33,445 --> 00:07:34,881
One little tity will speak volumes. 

142
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:36,348
You give I give, little miss, 

143
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:38,849
that’s the way justice works.

144
00:07:39,683 --> 00:07:42,074
Now you say somebody’s life is at stake.

145
00:07:42,955 --> 00:07:46,697
You tell me what you know and I will decide how much I show you.

146
00:07:46,697 --> 00:07:49,581
Booty upfront, that’s the way it works.

147
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:50,491
Goodbye, Mr. Bullock.

148
00:07:50,491 --> 00:07:52,362
Wait wait, no no, wait. 

149
00:07:53,814 --> 00:07:55,524
Okay.

150
00:08:01,827 --> 00:08:05,218
He got the facts about the murder by calling the coroner’s office 

151
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,244
pretending to be a police officer, 

152
00:08:07,244 --> 00:08:09,534
it ain’t hard, most are stupid.

153
00:08:09,534 --> 00:08:11,833
He calls an inmate reception centre, 

154
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,612
to get the skinny on the purp, 

155
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:15,960
pretending to be a bail bondsman.

156
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,014
Next he calls the DA’s record room, 

157
00:08:19,014 --> 00:08:21,531
posing as an asassistant District Attorney. 

158
00:08:22,618 --> 00:08:27,038
It’s all you need to find out anything about any crime.

159
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,278
You can get all these on a phone from prison?

160
00:08:31,252 --> 00:08:34,379
Fifteen minutes, I’ve seem Earl do it less.

161
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:39,254
All right, lady, tity show time.

162
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:46,880
That’s it? Stomach?

163
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,653
Bye Joe.

164
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:51,303
What? I give you everything and you give me stomach? 

165
00:08:51,303 --> 00:08:52,878
Man…

166
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:56,054
You want to what?

167
00:08:56,054 --> 00:08:59,669
A court order allowing us to exhume the body of Alisha Kerns.

168
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:02,283
Your Honour denied our request to have the rape kit tested 

169
00:09:02,283 --> 00:09:04,005
because it was old evidence.

170
00:09:04,005 --> 00:09:06,882
The night shirt and the casket is new evidence.

171
00:09:06,882 --> 00:09:08,368
How is that new evidence?

172
00:09:08,368 --> 00:09:10,928
It was no secret Alisha Kerns was wearing a night shirt 

173
00:09:10,928 --> 00:09:12,194
on the night of the crime 

174
00:09:12,194 --> 00:09:15,886
with due diligence Mr. Donovan’s lawyers could have tracked it down years ago.

175
00:09:15,886 --> 00:09:17,517
It was not foreseeable 

176
00:09:17,517 --> 00:09:20,103
that the victim would be buried in the night shirt she died in 

177
00:09:20,103 --> 00:09:22,662
in accordance with an ancient Jewish custom.

178
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,391
And with the existence of the rape kit, 

179
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:26,849
there was never a need to go looking for it.

180
00:09:27,294 --> 00:09:31,088
I would submit that we have a right to post conviction discovery.

181
00:09:31,088 --> 00:09:33,365
Under exceptional circumstances.

182
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:34,991
Stuart Donovan is about to be put to death, 

183
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,000
if that is not exceptional circumstances…

184
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,494
You don’t know there is DNA on that night shirt.

185
00:09:39,494 --> 00:09:41,070
If there is not, what are you afraid of?

186
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,269
You still get to execute him 

187
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:43,823
and you don’t have to cancel your party plans.

188
00:09:43,823 --> 00:09:47,118
I direct the court to Commonwealth versus Cleveland, 

189
00:09:47,118 --> 00:09:50,960
the court of appeals denied defendant’s motion for exhumation 

190
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,786
because the existence of the evidence saw was speculated and uncertain.

191
00:09:54,786 --> 00:09:58,181
Cleveland involved looking for trace of gunpowder residue, 

192
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:01,467
that's nowhere near the scientific certainty of DNA.

193
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,395
Your Honour, this crosses a line. 

194
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,848
They are looking to desecrate a grave 

195
00:10:06,848 --> 00:10:09,153
and victimize Mr. Kerns yet one more time.

196
00:10:09,153 --> 00:10:10,466
I object to that.

197
00:10:10,466 --> 00:10:13,850
I'd also like to point out that the prosecution of Stuart Donovan 

198
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,442
has now cost the taxer payer’s over one million dollars.

199
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:20,221
They had a trial; they had an appeal; 

200
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:22,703
they have since gone on to the state’s supreme court,

201
00:10:22,703 --> 00:10:23,878
the federal circuit court;

202
00:10:23,878 --> 00:10:25,377
they’ve come back to you twice, 

203
00:10:25,377 --> 00:10:27,535
they’ve gone to the United State Supreme Court.

204
00:10:27,535 --> 00:10:29,141
For every one of these Hail Mary’s, 

205
00:10:29,141 --> 00:10:32,389
the District Attorney’s office must file brief, we must show up.

206
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:35,442
We are now going on 13 years for over a million dollars, 

207
00:10:35,442 --> 00:10:37,390
now they come in looking to dig up the victim 

208
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,642
where in god’s name does it stop?

209
00:10:39,642 --> 00:10:41,554
With one simple DNA test.

210
00:10:41,554 --> 00:10:42,735
All right.

211
00:10:43,975 --> 00:10:47,545
The night shirt may very well be new evidence, 

212
00:10:47,545 --> 00:10:49,652
but there is no offer before me 

213
00:10:49,652 --> 00:10:54,677
that it even contains any DNA evidence much less exculpatory.

214
00:10:54,677 --> 00:10:56,865
Because nobody looked.

215
00:10:56,865 --> 00:11:00,959
Even so, under Cleveland, I can’t reopen on speculation.

216
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,594
And that’s all you're bargaining with.

217
00:11:03,594 --> 00:11:05,708
Your motion is denied.

218
00:11:19,768 --> 00:11:21,232
We’re still trying. 

219
00:11:21,232 --> 00:11:25,766
Lucy got some information on Earl Tylor how he gets his information.

220
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:30,430
And we are gonna go to Mr. Kerns tomorrow.

221
00:11:31,032 --> 00:11:33,174
He can authorize us to dig up the body.

222
00:11:33,174 --> 00:11:36,850
Why would any father agree to let his daughter get dug up?

223
00:11:40,884 --> 00:11:42,243
It’s over.

224
00:11:44,305 --> 00:11:45,813
Not yet.

225
00:11:45,813 --> 00:11:49,061
Where is my mother? Out crying now?

226
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,041
She’s at home.

227
00:12:07,547 --> 00:12:09,409
I've never believed that would happen.

228
00:12:11,504 --> 00:12:13,343
Even when I got sentenced 

229
00:12:13,343 --> 00:12:18,020
I figure, you know, it’s a mistake, I will get cleared up.

230
00:12:20,763 --> 00:12:22,902
Well, there. 

231
00:12:25,274 --> 00:12:27,333
The date is here.

232
00:12:31,774 --> 00:12:35,359
Jimmy and Eugene are gonna go look at the equipment.

233
00:12:36,328 --> 00:12:39,059
It’s only been used once in the past four years, 

234
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:42,241
so maybe if they could find…

235
00:13:00,942 --> 00:13:03,257
Why don’t we just go and dig up the body ourselves?

236
00:13:03,257 --> 00:13:04,937
We can’t do that.

237
00:13:04,937 --> 00:13:06,326
Why? Is this a crime? 

238
00:13:06,326 --> 00:13:08,069
I’ll serve the time. 

239
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:10,647
If I get DNA to clear my son.

240
00:13:10,647 --> 00:13:12,705
We can’t do that.

241
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,734
Listen, it’s probably not a bad idea 

242
00:13:15,734 --> 00:13:17,611
for you to go with Jimmy to see the father,

243
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:19,824
a mother’s agony.

244
00:13:22,322 --> 00:13:24,668
Does he know you are coming?

245
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:28,329
He doesn’t know what I am coming to ask him.

246
00:13:29,227 --> 00:13:33,416
And Euegen, I guess you should check the executional equipment, who knows.

247
00:13:41,212 --> 00:13:42,683
You okay?

248
00:13:45,503 --> 00:13:47,334
I am fine.

249
00:13:50,091 --> 00:13:52,575
I am fine.

250
00:14:00,082 --> 00:14:03,473
How did you expect me to respond, Mr. Berluti?

251
00:14:04,986 --> 00:14:06,315
Terrible. 

252
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:09,738
According to the mortician 

253
00:14:09,738 --> 00:14:13,391
the night shirt was folded and put in the casket. 

254
00:14:13,391 --> 00:14:16,412
We wouldn’t have to touch the remains of your daughter.

255
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:24,345
I can’t believe I am sitting in my own living room listening…

256
00:14:25,478 --> 00:14:29,167
Mr. Kerns, you and I have never spoken.

257
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:32,779
We both lost our children…

258
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:35,751
Mrs. Donovan, you and I have nothing in common.

259
00:14:37,831 --> 00:14:41,704
If there is DNA that matches up with my son, 

260
00:14:41,704 --> 00:14:44,741
I will drop any further appeal…

261
00:14:44,741 --> 00:14:46,438
You’re asking me 

262
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,159
to dig up my own daughter’s grave.

263
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:56,469
Mr. Kerns, I would think a father would want to know for sure…

264
00:14:56,469 --> 00:15:00,296
Oh, you would think that, would you, Mr. Berluti?

265
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:05,320
You won’t get closure unless you are sure.

266
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:11,192
You put that night shirt in the casket asking for god’s compassion.

267
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:17,763
The compassion we are asking for is yours.

268
00:15:22,825 --> 00:15:28,181
Please. I am begging you.

269
00:15:38,547 --> 00:15:40,821
What would you do?

270
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:47,037
Just open the lid, take the night shirt 

271
00:15:47,037 --> 00:15:49,941
and put her right back in the ground.

272
00:16:13,388 --> 00:16:14,450
All set?

273
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,842
Ready.

274
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,460
Connects to the execution.

275
00:16:27,683 --> 00:16:29,484
On the count of three. 

276
00:16:29,484 --> 00:16:32,381
One, two, three.

277
00:17:01,901 --> 00:17:03,401
Done.

278
00:17:03,401 --> 00:17:05,595
Okay, let’s start from the top. 

279
00:17:05,595 --> 00:17:07,917
This time we will do it as if the condemned was struggling.

280
00:17:13,678 --> 00:17:15,932
Yes, I understand that you’ll get back to me, 

281
00:17:15,932 --> 00:17:18,669
but I just want it brought to Justice Stroud’s attention 

282
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:21,114
that the execution date is tomorrow.

283
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:23,298
Yes. 

284
00:17:25,468 --> 00:17:27,755
Thank you, thank you very much.

285
00:17:28,785 --> 00:17:32,078
Supreme Court Justices aren’t even made aware of these request. 

286
00:17:32,078 --> 00:17:34,370
Their law clerks just stamp denied 

287
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,135
and then they go out to play basketball.

288
00:17:40,238 --> 00:17:42,611
Hello. 

289
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:45,869
One second, please.

290
00:17:46,776 --> 00:17:48,348
It’s the doctor from the lab.

291
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:51,793
Doctor Donum, Ellenor Frutt.

292
00:17:55,745 --> 00:17:57,098
Are you sure? 

293
00:17:57,098 --> 00:17:59,570
Okay, thank you.

294
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:03,080
Let me discuss it here and I will call you back.

295
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,438
Thank you.

296
00:18:06,575 --> 00:18:07,726
Well?

297
00:18:07,726 --> 00:18:09,551
There was DNA on the night shirt. 

298
00:18:09,551 --> 00:18:11,609
Two semen stains.

299
00:18:13,414 --> 00:18:15,500
It did not match Stuart’s.

300
00:18:21,457 --> 00:18:25,116
Thank you, god. Thank you.

301
00:18:32,353 --> 00:18:34,711
And we can document chain of custody.

302
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:38,396
Doctor Donum is a DNA specialist that your office uses 

303
00:18:38,396 --> 00:18:41,069
so you certainly aware of his credentials.

304
00:18:41,762 --> 00:18:42,344
Wow…

305
00:18:42,344 --> 00:18:46,021
I am hoping we can now offer a joined recommendation 

306
00:18:46,021 --> 00:18:48,018
asking for Stuart Donovan’s release.

307
00:18:48,018 --> 00:18:51,285
Well, I am not sure I can do that.

308
00:18:51,285 --> 00:18:55,206
Well you now have conclusive prove he didn’t do it.

309
00:18:55,206 --> 00:18:58,314
Did doctor Donum put these into the national database?

310
00:18:58,314 --> 00:19:00,019
He did, there’s been no ID.

311
00:19:04,357 --> 00:19:07,883
Look, I am not gonna pretend I am not shocked here 

312
00:19:07,883 --> 00:19:11,514
obviously this comes as quite a surprise.

313
00:19:11,514 --> 00:19:16,042
But it doesn’t clear Stuart Donovan. 

314
00:19:16,042 --> 00:19:20,976
It only means somebody else could have been there with him that night.

315
00:19:20,976 --> 00:19:21,790
What?

316
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,329
Stuart Donovan was seen going into that house.

317
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,426
At 9 o’clock.

318
00:19:25,426 --> 00:19:28,434
No. The witness said between 11:30 and 12.

319
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:31,085
The witness was a drunk who saw Johnny Carson on TV 

320
00:19:31,085 --> 00:19:33,053
and thought it was between 11:30 and 12.

321
00:19:33,053 --> 00:19:36,530
Mr. Young, we didn’t convict with semen stains on the night shirt,

322
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,171
we convicted with eye witness’s testimony, 

323
00:19:39,171 --> 00:19:40,566
we convicted with his confession.

324
00:19:40,566 --> 00:19:42,175
The confession was a lie.

325
00:19:42,175 --> 00:19:44,645
You say so, but I don’t have any evidence of that.

326
00:19:44,645 --> 00:19:45,812
I don’t believe I am hearing this, 

327
00:19:45,812 --> 00:19:47,477
you still plan to execute?

328
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,665
This new evidence only goes to show 

329
00:19:49,665 --> 00:19:53,394
somebody else could have been there in addition to your client.

330
00:19:53,394 --> 00:19:57,540
Or it could have been an old stain from the day before, the week before.

331
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,480
It doesn’t disprove the evidence against Stuart Donovan.

332
00:20:05,452 --> 00:20:07,363
How could they not let him go now? 

333
00:20:07,363 --> 00:20:08,968
I don’t understand.

334
00:20:08,968 --> 00:20:12,007
Come on, back to court.

335
00:20:12,007 --> 00:20:12,798
Federal?

336
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:14,058
Common, please.

337
00:20:14,058 --> 00:20:14,982
Judge Wood?

338
00:20:14,982 --> 00:20:17,502
If we went to Federal, they'd kick us back to State court on this.

339
00:20:17,502 --> 00:20:19,727
But state definitely don’t want to see me again.

340
00:20:19,727 --> 00:20:20,946
Judge Wood.

341
00:20:20,946 --> 00:20:21,853
He’s all we got.

342
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:22,929
Lucy, let’s go.

343
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:23,775
We can’t go to federal?

344
00:20:23,775 --> 00:20:26,286
Jimmy, see if there is a State court Law that we…

345
00:20:26,286 --> 00:20:26,967
Why Judge Wood?

346
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:28,851
Would you shut up!

347
00:20:37,495 --> 00:20:39,486
I am sorry.

348
00:20:39,486 --> 00:20:41,613
It’s just…

349
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,889
I am so sorry.

350
00:20:52,465 --> 00:20:56,207
Lucy, we need an affidavit of what Joe Bullock told you.

351
00:20:56,207 --> 00:21:00,296
Jimmy, get a declaration of Doctor Donum plus test results.

352
00:21:00,296 --> 00:21:00,841
Done.

353
00:21:00,841 --> 00:21:04,118
And keep calling the Supreme Court, harass them.

354
00:21:10,552 --> 00:21:12,399
You want me to argue?

355
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,886
No. I will do it.

356
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:29,304
Mary.

357
00:21:30,411 --> 00:21:32,910
It’s okay.

358
00:21:40,637 --> 00:21:41,921
Conspiracy? 

359
00:21:42,938 --> 00:21:44,802
Now they think it’s conspiracy?

360
00:21:44,802 --> 00:21:47,765
We’re going in to court again in the morning.

361
00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:50,696
Why are they doing this?

362
00:21:50,696 --> 00:21:55,867
Because they are desperate to believe they’ve got the right guy.

363
00:21:55,867 --> 00:21:59,609
Look, we've arranged to have you transfer to the court. 

364
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,958
Your presence there could count for something.

365
00:22:02,964 --> 00:22:04,725
Have we heard from the Supreme Court?

366
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:09,125
They don’t seem to be returning our calls this week.

367
00:22:10,221 --> 00:22:11,608
Where is Ellenor?

368
00:22:11,608 --> 00:22:14,064
She’s working on her statement for tomorrow’s hearing.

369
00:22:14,064 --> 00:22:15,745
We are not giving up, honey.

370
00:22:16,816 --> 00:22:20,878
Listen, if we lose 

371
00:22:20,878 --> 00:22:25,554
they will be taking you directly from court to the… 

372
00:22:27,356 --> 00:22:29,044
the place.

373
00:22:32,362 --> 00:22:34,123
The place

374
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,380
you mean the place where they put me to death?

375
00:22:41,786 --> 00:22:45,434
If you get people to say goodbye to here, 

376
00:22:45,434 --> 00:22:47,686
you’ll have to do it in the morning.

377
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:55,619
Whose semen was it?

378
00:22:55,619 --> 00:22:56,483
We don’t know. 

379
00:22:57,229 --> 00:22:58,989
I don’t think it proves anything, Michael.

380
00:22:58,989 --> 00:23:00,777
There could have been co-conspirators.

381
00:23:00,777 --> 00:23:02,549
And they are going back into the court again?

382
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,164
Before Judge Wood.

383
00:23:04,164 --> 00:23:07,938
These lawyers… they don’t quit.

384
00:23:07,938 --> 00:23:09,659
They dug up the rape kit on their own.

385
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:12,973
They… they are very good, Michael.

386
00:23:18,025 --> 00:23:19,558
I’ll argue.

387
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:20,750
Really?

388
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,337
This is the killer, right?

389
00:23:22,337 --> 00:23:23,788
I know it is.

390
00:23:23,788 --> 00:23:24,675
I’ll argue. 

391
00:23:24,675 --> 00:23:26,511
We are not losing him on the day of execution.

392
00:23:28,942 --> 00:23:29,942
Hey.

393
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,615
Hey.

394
00:23:37,317 --> 00:23:38,651
How is it going?

395
00:23:40,113 --> 00:23:41,628
Okay, I’ve just…

396
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,563
I’ve got so much here, I just…

397
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:46,884
I am not sure how to organize it all, you know, 

398
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:48,972
or even if I should argue everything.

399
00:23:48,972 --> 00:23:50,961
Judge Wood, he looks like… 

400
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:54,844
I just don’t know how long he’s gonna pay attention.

401
00:23:59,186 --> 00:24:00,914
When he first went to prison 

402
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:04,805
he kept banging his head up against the bars,

403
00:24:05,729 --> 00:24:09,500
for 48 hours he kept banging.

404
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,582
He said that he wouldn’t stop until somebody heard the truth.

405
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:19,968
And then they put him on antipsychotic medication for three years.

406
00:24:22,101 --> 00:24:24,104
Three years.

407
00:24:26,356 --> 00:24:29,766
Ellenor, you can’t take these things too personally.

408
00:24:29,766 --> 00:24:34,191
You won’t be any good to him if you let your emotions take over tomorrow.

409
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:40,587
Maybe you should do it, Eugene.

410
00:24:42,126 --> 00:24:44,794
I am not as ready as you are.

411
00:24:46,347 --> 00:24:49,136
I am having a hard time keep it all assorted.

412
00:24:49,136 --> 00:24:50,987
My anger, what happened to him,

413
00:24:50,987 --> 00:24:54,400
what truth is relevant to this type of hearing, 

414
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,816
what’s not…

415
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,623
I can tell you one thing, 

416
00:25:06,808 --> 00:25:09,705
I am never gonna do another death penalty case. 

417
00:25:12,301 --> 00:25:14,567
I can’t handle it.

418
00:25:18,447 --> 00:25:20,635
I just can’t.

419
00:25:48,745 --> 00:25:50,421
All rise.

420
00:25:56,243 --> 00:25:58,020
Be seated.

421
00:26:00,162 --> 00:26:02,273
All right, Ms. Frutt, here we are again. 

422
00:26:02,273 --> 00:26:04,410
The floor is yours.

423
00:26:06,996 --> 00:26:08,955
May I please the court, 

424
00:26:08,955 --> 00:26:13,189
we now have conclusive DNA evidence 

425
00:26:13,189 --> 00:26:17,110
establishing it was somebody else not Stuart Donovan 

426
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,380
who raped Alisha Kerns on that night, 

427
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,088
you have the reports in front of you.

428
00:26:21,088 --> 00:26:24,144
You also have the affidavit of Joe Bullock, 

429
00:26:24,144 --> 00:26:29,352
outlining exactly how Earl Tylor learned the details of the crime 

430
00:26:29,352 --> 00:26:32,682
which details allowed Earl Tylor to go to the District Attorney 

431
00:26:32,682 --> 00:26:34,512
with the falsified confession.

432
00:26:34,512 --> 00:26:40,822
A confession he used to get his own prison sentence reduced.

433
00:26:40,822 --> 00:26:43,502
You also have an affidavit from his ex-wife 

434
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:46,160
stating that Mr. Brasler was habitually drunk 

435
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,460
and passed out by 9 o’clock every night.

436
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:53,896
Mr. Brasler claims it was between 11:30 and 12 

437
00:26:53,896 --> 00:26:56,872
when he saw my client entered the victim’s house 

438
00:26:56,872 --> 00:26:58,734
and he’s basing that on the fact 

439
00:26:58,734 --> 00:27:01,344
that Johnny Carson was on the television.

440
00:27:01,344 --> 00:27:03,570
We have also shown by affidavit 

441
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:08,203
that Johnny Carson was in fact on during prime time the night of the murders 

442
00:27:08,203 --> 00:27:10,971
9 p.m. to 11 p.m. 

443
00:27:10,971 --> 00:27:12,904
in an anniversary special.

444
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:19,468
My client was convicted on three pieces of evidence, Your Honour.

445
00:27:19,468 --> 00:27:23,463
A confession fabricated by a jail house snitch.

446
00:27:23,463 --> 00:27:27,094
The eye witness testimony of an alcoholic 

447
00:27:27,094 --> 00:27:30,429
who was confused as to what time it really was.

448
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:32,252
And a blood type match 

449
00:27:32,252 --> 00:27:36,794
which is now been conclusively disproven with DNA testing.

450
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:44,139
As a matter of law, as a matter of simple justice, 

451
00:27:44,139 --> 00:27:47,896
Stuart Donovan’s conviction must be set aside 

452
00:27:47,896 --> 00:27:51,414
and he must be released immediately.

453
00:28:07,616 --> 00:28:10,011
Mr. Stanfield?

454
00:28:14,007 --> 00:28:18,835
We will not deny to this court we were shocked by the DNA evidence.

455
00:28:18,835 --> 00:28:22,558
We then test the rape kit and learned just 10 seconds ago 

456
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:24,714
it too did not match to Donovan.

457
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:31,225
My first reaction yesterday to the DNA discovery was that 

458
00:28:31,225 --> 00:28:33,998
Stuart Donovan should in fact be set free.

459
00:28:34,852 --> 00:28:38,345
But when we stop to think about it, 

460
00:28:39,157 --> 00:28:44,272
nothing has changed so dramatically that it will alter the verdict.

461
00:28:44,272 --> 00:28:47,496
As Ms. Frutt correctly states 

462
00:28:47,496 --> 00:28:50,203
Stuart Donovan was convicted on three pieces of evidence.

463
00:28:50,203 --> 00:28:52,397
First, the confession, 

464
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,516
that confession still stands.

465
00:28:54,516 --> 00:28:58,734
It was introduced into evidence at trial and challenged at trial. 

466
00:28:58,734 --> 00:29:01,550
Defence isn’t free to continue challenging it 

467
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:04,012
after the verdict without new evidence.

468
00:29:04,012 --> 00:29:05,663
And they don’t have any.

469
00:29:05,663 --> 00:29:07,989
They can argue all they want that is fabricated 

470
00:29:07,989 --> 00:29:12,354
that argument was made at trial and rejected by the jury.

471
00:29:12,354 --> 00:29:14,919
Second, the eyewitness’s testimony.

472
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:19,629
Again, the defence argued at trial that Mr. Brasal must've been mistaken 

473
00:29:19,629 --> 00:29:23,876
but there is nothing else to controvert that eyewitness’s testimony.

474
00:29:23,876 --> 00:29:26,997
Just as there is nothing else to controvert it today.

475
00:29:26,997 --> 00:29:29,531
Third, the blood match.

476
00:29:29,531 --> 00:29:31,294
If you look at the court transcripts 

477
00:29:31,294 --> 00:29:34,634
this was never a big part of the prosecution’s case.

478
00:29:34,634 --> 00:29:36,858
If you review the closing arguments

479
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,981
you will see we hammered two points: 

480
00:29:39,981 --> 00:29:42,724
The confession and the eyewitness’s testimony.

481
00:29:43,561 --> 00:29:48,069
Now, we can all say I would never agree with the jury on those points 

482
00:29:48,069 --> 00:29:51,895
but that is not the standard for a review.

483
00:29:51,895 --> 00:29:53,807
The question you have to ask 

484
00:29:53,807 --> 00:29:57,583
is whether these new evidence is of such character 

485
00:29:57,583 --> 00:30:01,193
that a different verdict will likely result.

486
00:30:01,788 --> 00:30:04,542
The answer to that is no.

487
00:30:04,542 --> 00:30:10,220
Because there is nothing to disprove either the confession or that testimony.

488
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:14,500
Not then, not now.

489
00:30:16,126 --> 00:30:18,671
All right, I will grant you that, Mr. Stanfield. 

490
00:30:18,671 --> 00:30:21,368
The court has no basis to throw out the confession 

491
00:30:21,368 --> 00:30:23,308
or the eyewitness’s testimony.

492
00:30:24,188 --> 00:30:27,830
But this new DNA evidence 

493
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,476
doesn’t that tell us somebody else did it?

494
00:30:30,476 --> 00:30:31,021
No, Your Honour. 

495
00:30:31,021 --> 00:30:34,263
It tells us that somebody else could have been there; 

496
00:30:34,263 --> 00:30:36,309
somebody else made love to her.

497
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:39,324
We have no timeline on that, could have been earlier.

498
00:30:39,324 --> 00:30:42,366
But it doesn’t change the fundamentals of our case.

499
00:30:42,366 --> 00:30:43,667
And let’s remember this 

500
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:46,385
Mr. Donovan didn’t confessed to Mr. Tylor

501
00:30:46,385 --> 00:30:51,398
that he raped anybody or that he made love to the victim before killing her.

502
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:55,244
He confessed only to murdering the two women.

503
00:30:55,244 --> 00:30:57,228
Hence, this new evidence does nothing 

504
00:30:57,228 --> 00:30:59,698
to undermine the veracity of that confession.

505
00:30:59,698 --> 00:31:01,817
Do you still think he did it?

506
00:31:01,817 --> 00:31:03,248
My personal beliefs aren't relevant.

507
00:31:03,248 --> 00:31:05,320
There are relevant to me. 

508
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,344
Do you think this is the man who killed those women?

509
00:31:08,344 --> 00:31:09,869
I do, your Honour.

510
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:13,949
He had a heated fight with Alisha Kerns just the day before.

511
00:31:13,949 --> 00:31:16,036
He refused to accept the end of the relationship.

512
00:31:16,036 --> 00:31:20,379
There is no sign of forced entry, so the idea of home invasion.

513
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:24,305
No fingerprints but his, no motive for anybody else.

514
00:31:24,305 --> 00:31:26,881
Look, he confessed to the crime. 

515
00:31:26,881 --> 00:31:28,819
You don’t free a man just because 

516
00:31:28,819 --> 00:31:32,043
it turns out that somebody else may have been there at the time.

517
00:31:32,043 --> 00:31:33,485
But you have to admit 

518
00:31:33,485 --> 00:31:36,924
it does change things if somebody else was there.

519
00:31:36,924 --> 00:31:38,958
Not enough to upset a verdict.

520
00:31:38,958 --> 00:31:43,745
Recently the Texas Court of Appeals was faced with the exact situation. 

521
00:31:43,745 --> 00:31:47,015
The DNA turned out not to match the defendant.

522
00:31:47,015 --> 00:31:49,826
The court refused to grant a new trial 

523
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:54,928
ruling that the DNA results did not preclude the presence of a co-conspirator.

524
00:31:54,928 --> 00:31:58,469
That was the case there, it's what we have here.

525
00:31:59,407 --> 00:32:01,356
You have precedent.

526
00:32:01,356 --> 00:32:03,747
You have the verdict of a jury.

527
00:32:04,804 --> 00:32:07,870
This court should honour both.

528
00:32:13,753 --> 00:32:17,630
You can’t rest. He was good.

529
00:32:21,092 --> 00:32:23,180
One more minute, Your Honour.

530
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,317
Go ahead.

531
00:32:28,879 --> 00:32:31,734
Five weeks ago when I took this case, 

532
00:32:31,734 --> 00:32:34,736
I almost immediately started getting emotional about it. 

533
00:32:34,736 --> 00:32:37,100
And I couldn’t figure out why.

534
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,502
I don’t know Stuart Donovan.

535
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,844
I realize now that what got to me is the reality 

536
00:32:44,844 --> 00:32:50,241
that people don’t get fair trials in this country, they often don’t.

537
00:32:50,241 --> 00:32:53,661
Mr. Frutt, I was the Judge on your client’s trial.

538
00:32:54,614 --> 00:32:58,531
And I don’t doubt that you did everything right, Your Honour.

539
00:32:58,531 --> 00:33:01,562
But Stuart Donovan had a public defender 

540
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:04,552
who had just finished another capital case 

541
00:33:04,552 --> 00:33:07,621
48 hours before his trial began.

542
00:33:07,621 --> 00:33:11,040
And that public defender wasn’t ready for this one. 

543
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,034
He didn’t discover a lot of the things he could have.

544
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:16,896
Defence lawyers, especially public defenders, 

545
00:33:16,896 --> 00:33:19,352
especially those taking court appointments, 

546
00:33:19,633 --> 00:33:22,248
we just don’t have enough time, 

547
00:33:22,248 --> 00:33:24,532
we just don’t have the resources.

548
00:33:24,532 --> 00:33:26,407
And it’s… it’s understandable.

549
00:33:26,407 --> 00:33:30,740
Things are bound to fall to the cracks, how could they not?

550
00:33:31,584 --> 00:33:36,377
But I have a man facing death here.

551
00:33:38,052 --> 00:33:40,611
Technically, from an evidentially standpoint, 

552
00:33:40,611 --> 00:33:43,594
Mr. Stanfield is right, the confession still stands.

553
00:33:43,594 --> 00:33:46,546
Technically, from an evidentially standpoint, 

554
00:33:46,546 --> 00:33:48,862
the eyewitness’s testimony is valid, 

555
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:51,208
the time to impeach it would have been at trial, 

556
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:52,744
that never happened.

557
00:33:52,744 --> 00:33:58,560
Technically, the prosecution’s two big pieces of evidence still hold up.

558
00:33:58,928 --> 00:34:00,490
Technically.

559
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:07,872
In reality, a man is going to be executed for a crime he didn’t commit.

560
00:34:07,872 --> 00:34:12,727
And as I have been pounding my head against walls, 

561
00:34:12,727 --> 00:34:14,351
I had been continuingly hearing: 

562
00:34:14,351 --> 00:34:16,553
Mr. Frutt, there is a system, 

563
00:34:16,553 --> 00:34:19,477
a system of evidence and appeals and…

564
00:34:23,784 --> 00:34:28,139
They system doesn’t always work, Your Honour.

565
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,813
In the last ten years alone, 

566
00:34:29,813 --> 00:34:33,318
over 44 people have been released from death row 

567
00:34:33,318 --> 00:34:35,792
from crimes they didn’t commit.

568
00:34:35,792 --> 00:34:40,924
The system uses jail house snitches who fabricate confessions; 

569
00:34:40,924 --> 00:34:43,577
the system has police lying; 

570
00:34:43,577 --> 00:34:47,225
the system is very, very fallible.

571
00:34:47,225 --> 00:34:49,678
And maybe it’s understandable, 

572
00:34:49,678 --> 00:34:53,334
given the enormous volume of criminal cases today,

573
00:34:53,334 --> 00:34:56,195
mistakes happen, lies happen.

574
00:34:56,195 --> 00:35:01,723
It is a byproduct of the system that I can almost comprehend.

575
00:35:03,544 --> 00:35:05,681
But what I can’t fathom

576
00:35:06,543 --> 00:35:08,866
is that when we have the ability 

577
00:35:08,866 --> 00:35:11,987
to find out the truth through DNA evidence, 

578
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:14,247
we don’t.

579
00:35:14,247 --> 00:35:16,992
In 48 states, this being one of them, 

580
00:35:16,992 --> 00:35:21,055
prisoners do not have the right to a simple DNA test 

581
00:35:21,055 --> 00:35:22,861
that can prove their innocence.

582
00:35:22,861 --> 00:35:25,473
You wouldn’t let us have one, Judge.

583
00:35:25,473 --> 00:35:27,842
We had to go to the father of the victim,

584
00:35:27,842 --> 00:35:32,542
miraculously he let us dig up his daughter.

585
00:35:32,542 --> 00:35:35,594
And after we did that, did the test on our own, 

586
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:38,968
we pretty much proved Stuart Donovan’s innocence.

587
00:35:38,968 --> 00:35:42,490
And still it hasn’t ended. 

588
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:47,884
Mr. Stanfield now gets up, changes the prosecution's theory 

589
00:35:47,884 --> 00:35:51,457
and refocuses the court’s attentions on eyewitness’s testimony 

590
00:35:51,457 --> 00:35:53,076
and a jail house informant 

591
00:35:53,076 --> 00:35:56,365
which everyone in the room regards a suspect.

592
00:35:56,365 --> 00:36:00,677
As technically admissible as it may be on evidently grounds, 

593
00:36:01,528 --> 00:36:04,959
none of us in this room fully believe that snitch, 

594
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:08,647
none of us fully trust that eyewitness' account 

595
00:36:08,647 --> 00:36:12,199
and a man is going to die.

596
00:36:14,236 --> 00:36:17,981
Is our system about getting convictions? 

597
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,332
Is that it?

598
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:23,539
My co-counsel, Eugene Young, 

599
00:36:23,539 --> 00:36:26,192
told me not to take this case personally. 

600
00:36:28,536 --> 00:36:30,130
How can I not? 

601
00:36:30,746 --> 00:36:33,297
How can't we all?

602
00:36:34,135 --> 00:36:35,614
A man,

603
00:36:39,304 --> 00:36:43,257
an innocent man is going to die.

604
00:36:43,257 --> 00:36:45,690
As human beings, 

605
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:48,495
as officers of this court, 

606
00:36:48,495 --> 00:36:52,853
as players in this system, 

607
00:36:55,556 --> 00:36:59,244
how do we not take that personally?

608
00:37:19,782 --> 00:37:23,753
I hear Ms. Frutt’s frustration or emotion; 

609
00:37:25,714 --> 00:37:28,553
I’d like the court to consider it from our side 

610
00:37:28,553 --> 00:37:30,204
and from the victim’s families.

611
00:37:30,204 --> 00:37:32,681
You find the person who commits the murder, 

612
00:37:32,681 --> 00:37:36,929
you put that person on trial, you secure a conviction.

613
00:37:38,686 --> 00:37:40,441
That’s not easy these days, 

614
00:37:41,309 --> 00:37:43,913
but even when you're lucky enough to get that far, 

615
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:49,854
the defence attorneys keep coming back over and over and over again 

616
00:37:49,854 --> 00:37:51,313
raising constitutional claims 

617
00:37:51,313 --> 00:37:54,533
saying that the previous attorneys weren’t good enough.

618
00:37:54,533 --> 00:37:58,404
Twelve years they have been coming back on this one, 

619
00:37:58,404 --> 00:38:03,465
twelve years this father, this husband 

620
00:38:03,465 --> 00:38:06,810
has been waiting for this to be over.

621
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:11,382
And this on the case where the defendant confessed, 

622
00:38:11,382 --> 00:38:15,458
this on the case where we have eyewitness' testimony.

623
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:17,998
Most times, the defence attorneys are in here 

624
00:38:17,998 --> 00:38:20,691
trying to free their clients on technical grounds, 

625
00:38:20,691 --> 00:38:23,480
Exulting the system above all else.

626
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,435
But here where the system has been adhere to, 

627
00:38:26,435 --> 00:38:30,132
where the evidence is all sound technically, 

628
00:38:30,132 --> 00:38:32,462
they’re in here…

629
00:38:37,631 --> 00:38:40,458
We have his confession on record, 

630
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:44,235
the jury believed that confession.

631
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,565
Why don’t we just let everybody go?

632
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:31,295
I am persuaded by defence counsel’s arguments 

633
00:39:31,295 --> 00:39:33,430
that before we put a man to death 

634
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:36,848
we should be sure of the person’s guilt 

635
00:39:36,848 --> 00:39:39,496
and not simply limit our inquiry 

636
00:39:39,496 --> 00:39:42,369
as to whether the trial was technically sound 

637
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:45,180
from an evidentiary stand point.

638
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:50,824
That seems so obvious.

639
00:39:50,824 --> 00:39:54,669
But Mr. Stanfield’s contention is also a valid one. 

640
00:39:54,669 --> 00:39:59,295
We could keep reevaluating evidence ** forever.

641
00:39:59,295 --> 00:40:04,149
The point of a trial is to reach a final verdict on the facts, 

642
00:40:04,149 --> 00:40:07,317
and though it would be nice to reconsider the confession, 

643
00:40:07,317 --> 00:40:09,963
take a second or third look at the testimony, 

644
00:40:09,963 --> 00:40:14,658
if we did that for one, we'd have to do it for all.

645
00:40:14,658 --> 00:40:16,674
And if we did it for all 

646
00:40:16,674 --> 00:40:21,133
surly the court docket would clot beyond repair 

647
00:40:21,133 --> 00:40:23,829
and it would be no justice to anybody.

648
00:40:24,684 --> 00:40:29,928
Ms. Frutt, it was the confession and the eye witness’s testimony 

649
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,930
that convicted your client.

650
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:36,384
Both of these elements were vigorously challenged at trial 

651
00:40:36,384 --> 00:40:40,169
and though you clearly like to keep on renewing the challenge 

652
00:40:40,169 --> 00:40:42,877
under the law you don’t get to, 

653
00:40:42,877 --> 00:40:44,859
not with what you brought me.

654
00:40:45,813 --> 00:40:48,259
But Mr. Stanfield, 

655
00:40:48,259 --> 00:40:50,998
had you had this DNA evidence 

656
00:40:50,998 --> 00:40:56,397
clearly you would have been investigate the possibility of another suspect, 

657
00:40:56,397 --> 00:40:58,339
you didn’t.

658
00:40:59,114 --> 00:41:01,680
I am an old man. 

659
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,349
I look at each cigarette as possibly my last.

660
00:41:06,156 --> 00:41:10,310
My last breath won’t be spent executing a man 

661
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:15,381
I now think is probably innocent.

662
00:41:15,381 --> 00:41:17,620
The conviction is set aside, 

663
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:21,367
Mr. Donovan, you are free with the apologies of this court. 

664
00:41:21,367 --> 00:41:23,173
Adjourned.

665
00:41:27,823 --> 00:41:30,016
How about that?

666
00:41:32,966 --> 00:41:35,458
Yeah!
