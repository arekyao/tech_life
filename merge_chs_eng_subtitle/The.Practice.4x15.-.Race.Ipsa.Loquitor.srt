1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,280
Previous on The Practice:

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,242
Did you murder her because she was gonna break up a sexual affair?

3
00:00:05,242 --> 00:00:08,423
I did not have an affair with her and I did not kill her.

4
00:00:08,423 --> 00:00:10,477
You’re going down for murder now, you get that?

5
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:11,734
It was Steven.

6
00:00:11,734 --> 00:00:13,270
Your son Steven?

7
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,951
I saw the door closed on him when he left.

8
00:00:15,951 --> 00:00:17,381
Why haven’t you told anybody these?

9
00:00:17,381 --> 00:00:19,890
Because I don’t want him to spend the rest of his life in jail 

10
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,258
for something I drove him to.

11
00:00:21,258 --> 00:00:22,678
Let me go to the DA.

12
00:00:22,678 --> 00:00:23,724
Absolutely not.

13
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:26,731
This is between you and me, you gave me your word.

14
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:28,778
We find the defendant guilty.

15
00:00:31,567 --> 00:00:34,498
I didn’t do it. I didn’t do it.

16
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,089
Your dad saw you going out the door. 

17
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:39,701
The reason he staying quiet 

18
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:41,744
he doesn’t wanna see you go to prison. 

19
00:00:41,744 --> 00:00:43,762
He loves you too much for that.

20
00:00:43,762 --> 00:00:46,258
Jimmy, what happened?

21
00:00:46,258 --> 00:00:51,472
Steven Olson, he just hung himself in the garage.

22
00:00:51,472 --> 00:00:54,547
You think I am gonna ask the judge to release a convicted murderer 

23
00:00:54,547 --> 00:00:56,885
on the grounds of his defence attorney says he is innocent?

24
00:00:56,885 --> 00:00:59,114
I expect you to because he is innocent.

25
00:00:59,114 --> 00:01:01,391
For all we know the kid hung himself because his father is a killer.

26
00:01:01,391 --> 00:01:02,239
That isn’t the case.

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,787
Well give me evidence.

28
00:01:25,281 --> 00:01:26,589
Henry.

29
00:01:35,222 --> 00:01:36,477
Hey.

30
00:01:36,477 --> 00:01:38,432
Hey.

31
00:01:40,254 --> 00:01:41,525
What happened?

32
00:01:41,525 --> 00:01:43,903
They tried to rape me.

33
00:01:46,912 --> 00:01:48,781
Inmates?

34
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,790
Two of them.

35
00:01:52,547 --> 00:01:54,833
I covered my ass.

36
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:58,236
But my face didn’t fare so well.

37
00:01:58,236 --> 00:02:01,528
Doctor say you're ganna be okay.

38
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:03,441
I want solitary, Jimmy.

39
00:02:03,441 --> 00:02:07,217
I don’t wanna be in the general population anymore.

40
00:02:08,314 --> 00:02:11,948
Can you get me solitary, Jimmy?

41
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,829
听写：诸如

42
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,934
时间轴：美溪客

43
00:03:03,746 --> 00:03:07,236
Richard, I wanna reopen the Henry Olson case.

44
00:03:07,236 --> 00:03:08,367
On what grounds?

45
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:09,795
On the grounds he’s innocent.

46
00:03:09,795 --> 00:03:12,663
Jimmy, I told you, bring me new evidence then I can do…

47
00:03:12,663 --> 00:03:15,734
There is no new evidence, but that doesn’t change the truth.

48
00:03:15,734 --> 00:03:17,445
The guy didn’t do it.

49
00:03:17,445 --> 00:03:19,820
Okay, I got a pretrial, can we talk later?

50
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,384
Yeah.

51
00:03:22,486 --> 00:03:24,289
Listen, if the DA goes forward…

52
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:25,355
That’s not gonna happen.

53
00:03:25,355 --> 00:03:26,766
Why? Because of your conviction, right?

54
00:03:26,766 --> 00:03:28,761
Because I don’t believe he’s innocent.

55
00:03:28,761 --> 00:03:31,995
The case went to a verdict, the right man is serving time.

56
00:03:31,995 --> 00:03:34,213
I need a favor here.

57
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,162
I am sorry, no.

58
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,735
I filed a petition to reopen.

59
00:03:40,735 --> 00:03:43,156
Clyde Miller, murder in the first degree.

60
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,274
Hold on.

61
00:03:45,261 --> 00:03:47,006
Richard Bay for the Commonwealth, Your Honour, 

62
00:03:47,006 --> 00:03:49,071
we oppose bail of any kind.

63
00:03:49,071 --> 00:03:51,781
The suspect is obviously a flight risk, not to mention…

64
00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:52,920
Is he represented?

65
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,397
**, we are waiting for somebody from the PD’s office.

66
00:03:57,605 --> 00:04:01,729
Mr. Berluti, come meet your new client.

67
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:04,283
I am not taking appointment today, Judge.

68
00:04:04,283 --> 00:04:05,409
Well I am afraid you are. 

69
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:07,370
We’ll enter a not guilty for now.

70
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,324
Meet with Mr. Miller, then we'll conference.

71
00:04:09,324 --> 00:04:10,572
Your Honour, I can’t take…

72
00:04:10,572 --> 00:04:12,777
Are you in trial, Mr. Berluti?

73
00:04:13,332 --> 00:04:13,972
No. but…

74
00:04:13,972 --> 00:04:15,419
Then meet with Mr. Miller.

75
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:16,667
Next case. Please.

76
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:20,790
People versus Megan Baucher, solicitation and loitering.

77
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:31,122
Can I get you some more coffee?

78
00:04:31,122 --> 00:04:34,592
This is my third cup. Is Mr. Bradford not available?

79
00:04:34,592 --> 00:04:37,910
He’s just finishing up a conference call. He will be right…

80
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,051
He’s been finishing that call for some time. 

81
00:04:40,051 --> 00:04:42,550
We have other business scheduled for the day. 

82
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,407
If he’s too busy…

83
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:46,047
I apologize. Thank you, Sheila.

84
00:04:46,047 --> 00:04:48,657
I am sorry, Eugene, Rebecca.

85
00:04:48,657 --> 00:04:52,695
I have actually been conferencing with the insurance company and Doctor Stiles.

86
00:04:52,695 --> 00:04:56,825
I pushed them up to 32, that’s as far as it’ll go.

87
00:04:56,825 --> 00:04:59,235
Doctor Stiles is angry to be settling at all.

88
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:01,622
32?

89
00:05:01,622 --> 00:05:02,584
Yes.

90
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:05,813
32 thousand.

91
00:05:05,813 --> 00:05:06,738
Yes.

92
00:05:07,644 --> 00:05:10,900
A man is dead; you’re offering 32 thousand dollars.

93
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,953
Well it’s not a question of the worth of the deceased, Eugene, 

94
00:05:13,953 --> 00:05:15,588
you know that, the issue is liability.

95
00:05:15,588 --> 00:05:17,991
My client died on the doctor’s table.

96
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:24,229
Look, you and I could debate this **, we are never going to agree.

97
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:26,474
And my client is adamant, 

98
00:05:26,474 --> 00:05:30,947
so, either we are going to end this at 32 thousand 

99
00:05:30,947 --> 00:05:33,602
or we are going to have to let the jury decide.

100
00:05:34,826 --> 00:05:37,729
We will be letting the jury decide.

101
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,514
I didn’t know he was a rabbi, I swear I didn’t know.

102
00:05:50,514 --> 00:05:51,911
I understand this, but Clyde, 

103
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:53,608
whether you knew he was a Rabbi or not 

104
00:05:53,608 --> 00:05:55,703
it was still illegal for you to kill him

105
00:05:55,703 --> 00:05:58,865
Is that mean they're gonna get me like one of those hate crimes?

106
00:05:58,865 --> 00:06:01,897
coz he’s Jewish, I get nailed with a hate crime?

107
00:06:01,897 --> 00:06:03,872
Clyde, hate crime isn’t your worry; 

108
00:06:03,872 --> 00:06:05,599
you are up on first degree murder.

109
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,574
You hit a Rabbi over the head with a bat.

110
00:06:07,574 --> 00:06:11,339
But don’t they gotta prove intent? My intent was to rob him.

111
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:16,130
This is prejudice. The Jewish, they get special treatment.

112
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,927
You think Jews get special treatment on account 

113
00:06:18,927 --> 00:06:20,838
you’re not being able to hit rabbis with bats?

114
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:25,668
I just meant to rob him. I was swinging him for a shoulder blade.

115
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:28,559
I am begging you.

116
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:31,305
All right, I am Jewish,I really wanna take this off your hands.

117
00:06:31,305 --> 00:06:32,177
He’s not gonna hit you.

118
00:06:32,177 --> 00:06:33,083
Forget it.

119
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,053
Lindsay.

120
00:06:34,053 --> 00:06:35,571
I’ve got these depositions all week.

121
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:36,497
Oh, come on.

122
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:37,220
What’s wrong?

123
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,709
I am going to court tomorrow, trying to reopen on Henry Olson. 

124
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:42,932
Judge just spanked me with a court appointed “lujack” 

125
00:06:42,932 --> 00:06:44,707
and nobody here would lend a hand 

126
00:06:44,707 --> 00:06:46,784
after I just flew across country to help you.

127
00:06:46,784 --> 00:06:49,694
-Jimmy, I can’t. I pinch all my case before me. -I am in a **  I need some assistance.

128
00:06:49,694 --> 00:06:51,469
All right, Ellenor, back him up.

129
00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:53,167
-Why can’t Lindsay do it?-Why can I just give it to her?

130
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:55,093
Because it’s on the news, Jimmy.

131
00:06:55,093 --> 00:06:57,902
There is a big public outcry, have you been paying attention?

132
00:06:57,902 --> 00:06:59,898
Well, I got a motion to reopen on Henry Olson…

133
00:06:59,898 --> 00:07:01,893
I will help on Olson, Ellenor.

134
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,350
Basically they are still denying blame. 

135
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,663
The doctor evidently is reluctant to settle at all.

136
00:07:12,663 --> 00:07:14,583
So what happens now?

137
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,072
Well, we still schedule for trial tomorrow, 

138
00:07:17,072 --> 00:07:20,001
you can either take the 32 which…

139
00:07:22,136 --> 00:07:25,583
Well, our cost right now are running over 14, 

140
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:30,442
so that plus the contingency, you get about 11.

141
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:33,247
11 thousand dollars?

142
00:07:33,247 --> 00:07:35,010
You make out better than us.

143
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,030
Between my time and Eugene’s, 

144
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,429
we’ve got over 14 thousand investing in this case.

145
00:07:39,429 --> 00:07:42,506
So, why are we even hesitating? Let’s go to trial.

146
00:07:42,506 --> 00:07:44,741
Mrs. Riley, I will be honest. 

147
00:07:44,741 --> 00:07:46,757
This is a very tough case to win.

148
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:50,782
Now I believe the doctor was negligent, but proving it…

149
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:56,350
I know 11 is not much, but I am sure you could use the money.

150
00:07:58,346 --> 00:08:00,969
Is there a woman that you love, Mr. Young?

151
00:08:02,374 --> 00:08:03,338
Yes.

152
00:08:04,031 --> 00:08:08,367
Well I’ll tell you, the day comes some doctor kills her, 

153
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:10,880
the day comes you have to bury her, 

154
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,164
I don’t think you’re gonna be walking away for 11 thousand dollars 

155
00:08:15,164 --> 00:08:18,141
whether you could use the money or not.

156
00:08:32,609 --> 00:08:33,803
How you doing?

157
00:08:34,632 --> 00:08:35,744
Okay.

158
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:38,743
They’re letting me out tomorrow. 

159
00:08:38,743 --> 00:08:40,689
Did you get me isolation?

160
00:08:42,486 --> 00:08:46,302
They stuck the guy who did this to you in a hole, Henry, so…

161
00:08:47,104 --> 00:08:49,179
They'll be ** this, Jimmy. 

162
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:54,075
I am a freak; I am the guy with the bug fetish.

163
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,905
Okay, I’ll take care of it.

164
00:08:58,632 --> 00:09:00,465
Meantime, 

165
00:09:02,472 --> 00:09:05,981
I get a motion set tomorrow to reopen your case.

166
00:09:05,981 --> 00:09:08,195
Is there any chance?

167
00:09:08,195 --> 00:09:10,711
I don’t know. But I am gonna fight. 

168
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:13,931
I promise you, I am gonna fight.

169
00:09:18,873 --> 00:09:21,141
I…

170
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:27,473
I never told you how sorry I am that he took his life.

171
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:33,387
On account of me…

172
00:09:35,043 --> 00:09:36,677
It was me.

173
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:38,983
If I hadn’t confronted him 

174
00:09:40,556 --> 00:09:42,989
which I had no legal right to do.

175
00:09:42,989 --> 00:09:47,943
Jimmy, consider who he had for a father. 

176
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,438
You are a good man, Henry. 

177
00:09:52,438 --> 00:09:55,373
You’ve always been a good man.

178
00:09:55,373 --> 00:09:57,504
Your son knew that.

179
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:03,493
Yeah.

180
00:10:03,493 --> 00:10:06,100
I am gonna fight.

181
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:28,845
I used to date a Jewish girl. I am not prejudiced. 

182
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:31,592
I only hit the guy because he wouldn’t give me his money.

183
00:10:31,592 --> 00:10:33,770
Clyde, will you get off the Jewish thing? 

184
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:37,584
It don’t matter that the victim was Jewish, what matters is he’s dead.

185
00:10:37,584 --> 00:10:39,881
Oh… you don’t know what this is gonna do to my parents.

186
00:10:39,881 --> 00:10:41,805
They’re calling you a murderer, you think they would proud?

187
00:10:41,805 --> 00:10:42,695
All right, Jimmy.

188
00:10:42,695 --> 00:10:44,823
Forget that he was a rabbi.

189
00:10:45,257 --> 00:10:47,731
All right. 

190
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:52,256
Look, tell me what you were doing at the hour to begin with.

191
00:10:52,256 --> 00:10:55,084
I was high, I was waiting to mug somebody. 

192
00:10:55,084 --> 00:10:56,943
But I wouldn’t hit any religion, I swear.

193
00:10:56,943 --> 00:10:57,574
Guard!

194
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,164
Look, I am due in court in another matter, 

195
00:11:00,164 --> 00:11:01,872
I am gonna come back after lunch. 

196
00:11:01,872 --> 00:11:03,426
Don’t talk to anybody, you hear me?

197
00:11:03,426 --> 00:11:04,170
Nobody.

198
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,349
Fine, I am not a talker.

199
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:07,383
You are a thinker.

200
00:11:07,383 --> 00:11:08,059
Jimmy.

201
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:11,789
The guy’s got the IQ of a relief pitcher.

202
00:11:12,491 --> 00:11:14,189
It was a birthday present.

203
00:11:14,189 --> 00:11:15,344
From you to your husband?

204
00:11:15,344 --> 00:11:18,062
Yes. He just couldn’t take being fat.

205
00:11:18,062 --> 00:11:19,520
So as a birthday gift.

206
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,904
I took him to Doctor Stiles to talk about lipo suction.

207
00:11:22,904 --> 00:11:25,573
And how did you hear of Doctor Stiles, Mrs. Riley?

208
00:11:25,573 --> 00:11:26,894
I saw his add.

209
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,059
And when you went to see him?

210
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:29,359
Everything was fine.

211
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:31,789
He said my husband was a good candidate. 

212
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:34,626
It was every exciting for my husband. 

213
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:35,783
He couldn’t wait to do it.

214
00:11:35,783 --> 00:11:38,704
So, you decided to go for the surgery.

215
00:11:38,704 --> 00:11:42,287
Yes. It was just supposed to be an outpatient thing.

216
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:49,224
So, we arrived at his office at seven in the morning and at the… 

217
00:11:49,224 --> 00:11:51,884
the procedure started at 10.

218
00:11:51,884 --> 00:11:56,172
And then at one o’clock he…hm… 

219
00:11:56,933 --> 00:12:01,777
the doctor came out and told me that my husband was dead.

220
00:12:04,627 --> 00:12:07,270
Your husband was told that there was a risk.

221
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,697
Minimal risk.

222
00:12:08,697 --> 00:12:11,595
Possible risk of death, wasn’t that one?

223
00:12:11,595 --> 00:12:14,451
Yes. It wasn’t something… 

224
00:12:14,451 --> 00:12:20,209
the message was that this operation was safe, Mr. Bradford.

225
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:25,254
Please understand just how sorry I am for your loss.

226
00:12:27,061 --> 00:12:30,692
Mrs. Riley, who is the first person to suggest you 

227
00:12:30,692 --> 00:12:32,880
that Doctor Stiles might’ve been negligent?

228
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,222
First person?

229
00:12:34,222 --> 00:12:35,031
Yes.

230
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,384
Well, I am afraid I don’t really understand the question.

231
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:42,776
Well, let me state it another way: was it a doctor or was it a lawyer?

232
00:12:42,776 --> 00:12:43,635
Objection!

233
00:12:43,635 --> 00:12:45,123
What’s the point, Mr. Bradford?

234
00:12:45,123 --> 00:12:49,162
Well, Your Honour, there are those cases where a doctor says negligence 

235
00:12:49,162 --> 00:12:51,096
and the plaintiff then engages a lawyer 

236
00:12:51,096 --> 00:12:54,565
and then there are other cases where a lawyer declares negligence 

237
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,229
and doctors then round it up to bolsterthe claim. 

238
00:12:57,229 --> 00:12:57,980
Objection!

239
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,549
Rephrase it, Counsel.

240
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:03,666
Mrs. Riley, just how many firms did you go to 

241
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,429
before finally one wanted to take your case?

242
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:06,098
Objection!

243
00:13:06,098 --> 00:13:07,339
Sidebar? Your Honour.

244
00:13:12,138 --> 00:13:16,011
Part of our defence is this is a ** claim manufactured 

245
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:18,522
to flush out the deep pocket of the insurance company.

246
00:13:18,522 --> 00:13:20,038
And it certainly relevant that 

247
00:13:20,038 --> 00:13:22,551
other attorneys decline to even take on the matter.

248
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:23,784
It’s certainly not relevant. 

249
00:13:23,784 --> 00:13:26,195
How other lawyer assess this has nothing to do with the case.

250
00:13:26,195 --> 00:13:28,943
I agree. You are shut down there, Mr. Bradford.

251
00:13:28,943 --> 00:13:29,907
Step back.

252
00:13:29,907 --> 00:13:32,117
Members of the jury, 

253
00:13:32,117 --> 00:13:34,819
whether or not other attorneys or law firms 

254
00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:38,283
elected to represent the plaintiff in this matter is without relevance,

255
00:13:38,283 --> 00:13:41,330
and you are to disregard the defence counsel’s question.

256
00:13:45,304 --> 00:13:47,200
Let me see if I understand this: 

257
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,495
You learned during the trial from your client 

258
00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:53,642
that it was his son that killed the woman.

259
00:13:53,642 --> 00:13:56,113
I learned just before closing arguments, yes.

260
00:13:56,113 --> 00:13:59,557
Then why didn’t you go to the District Attorney right then and ask him…

261
00:13:59,557 --> 00:14:01,068
Because my client wouldn’t let me.

262
00:14:01,068 --> 00:14:05,527
It was attorney-client privilege and he was looking to protect his son.

263
00:14:05,527 --> 00:14:06,357
I see. 

264
00:14:06,357 --> 00:14:09,142
And if your client had been acquitted, that would’ve been the end of it.

265
00:14:09,142 --> 00:14:10,390
Well…

266
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,582
You wouldn’t be here today seeking justice, would you, counsel?

267
00:14:13,582 --> 00:14:15,046
That would’ve been the end of it.

268
00:14:15,046 --> 00:14:18,303
Your Honour, my meeting with the boy 

269
00:14:18,303 --> 00:14:21,014
though he didn’t flat out admit that he did it, 

270
00:14:21,014 --> 00:14:22,575
he didn’t deny it either.

271
00:14:22,575 --> 00:14:24,292
And a failure to deny 

272
00:14:24,292 --> 00:14:27,494
can constitute an admission under the rule of evidence.

273
00:14:27,494 --> 00:14:30,837
The courts don’t simply throw out convictions, counsel. 

274
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:31,774
Simply because…

275
00:14:31,774 --> 00:14:34,115
The kid hung himself. What does that say?

276
00:14:34,115 --> 00:14:37,919
I confronted him on what he did, he goes home and hung himself.

277
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,494
That isn’t evidence.

278
00:14:39,494 --> 00:14:41,134
Then let me offer evidence.

279
00:14:41,134 --> 00:14:42,330
You haven’t got any, Jimmy.

280
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,758
I would like the court to hear from my client.

281
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,507
It seems like a waste of the court’s time.

282
00:14:46,507 --> 00:14:49,788
He’s serving a life sentence, we can't waste one afternoon?

283
00:14:54,229 --> 00:14:55,761
One day.

284
00:14:58,095 --> 00:15:00,000
I don’t know what you really plan to accomplish.

285
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,404
I plan to accomplish getting him out of prison which he should be.

286
00:15:02,404 --> 00:15:04,795
Yeah right. Look, how about we get together on Miller?

287
00:15:04,795 --> 00:15:07,356
Fine, corporate with me on Olson and I will talk to Miller.

288
00:15:07,356 --> 00:15:09,172
Don’t insult my intelligence, Jimmy.

289
00:15:09,172 --> 00:15:11,844
I was insulting your integrity.

290
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,765
Fluid is actually being pumped into the body at this point.

291
00:15:21,765 --> 00:15:25,196
It’s pretty much a sole solution containing a local anesthetic.

292
00:15:25,196 --> 00:15:26,776
What kind of anesthetic?

293
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,667
Lidocaine. It numbs the patient.

294
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:32,036
Is this a difficult procedure, doctor?

295
00:15:32,036 --> 00:15:35,244
It’s quite simple actually, which is part of the problem.

296
00:15:35,244 --> 00:15:38,456
We’ve got dentist doing it, dermatologist.

297
00:15:38,456 --> 00:15:41,068
It’s lucrative and a lot of doctors want in 

298
00:15:41,068 --> 00:15:42,093
and if they are not careful 

299
00:15:42,093 --> 00:15:45,137
the procedure can be lethal as it was in this case.

300
00:15:45,137 --> 00:15:47,863
What happened to Moris Riley?

301
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:51,069
The first mistake was taking so much fat out 

302
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:54,583
anything over 15 percent in my view is unsafe.

303
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,327
Is this what killed him?

304
00:15:56,327 --> 00:15:57,123
No. 

305
00:15:57,123 --> 00:16:00,779
In my opinion, Mr. Riley suffered from a lidocaine over dose.

306
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:04,403
The lidocaine lowered the heart rate eventually causing cardiac arrest.

307
00:16:04,403 --> 00:16:07,873
And since he did this in his office instead of at the hospital, 

308
00:16:07,873 --> 00:16:09,877
he didn’t have the necessary technology 

309
00:16:09,877 --> 00:16:12,800
or personal available to respond to the crisis.

310
00:16:14,517 --> 00:16:17,074
You weren’t in the room, were you, Dr. Willis?

311
00:16:17,074 --> 00:16:18,223
No, I was not.

312
00:16:18,223 --> 00:16:20,595
Have you ever preformed a lipo suction procedure, sir?

313
00:16:20,595 --> 00:16:22,029
Have done hundreds.

314
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:24,374
Hundreds. Any in your office?

315
00:16:24,374 --> 00:16:25,646
Almost all of them.

316
00:16:25,646 --> 00:16:26,564
I see. 

317
00:16:26,564 --> 00:16:28,685
So this decision not to go into a hospital 

318
00:16:28,685 --> 00:16:30,293
you make that decision all the time.

319
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:33,366
I would never take that much fat out in my office.

320
00:16:33,366 --> 00:16:35,605
If I were going to remove more 12 pounds 

321
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:37,373
I would have done it in a hospital.

322
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:40,443
That’s a very good answer, doctor.

323
00:16:40,443 --> 00:16:42,651
Can you state to a medical certainty 

324
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:45,383
that Mr. Riley died from a lidocaine over dose?

325
00:16:45,383 --> 00:16:47,590
I can state it to a reasonable certainty.

326
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,870
But not to an absolute medical certainty.

327
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,655
That can almost never be done, counsel.

328
00:16:51,655 --> 00:16:52,101
I see. 

329
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:55,606
And have you ever known hearts to go into arrest during this procedure 

330
00:16:55,606 --> 00:16:57,522
absent a lidocaine over dose?

331
00:16:57,522 --> 00:16:58,370
Off course.

332
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,850
That’s possible here, isn’t it, doctor?

333
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,680
Possible. But my opinion is they over loaded him with fluids.

334
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,836
I see. 

335
00:17:04,684 --> 00:17:09,230
Tell me, doctor, how many trials have you testified in over the last year?

336
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:09,947
Many.

337
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:12,663
Many? More than 50?

338
00:17:13,317 --> 00:17:14,300
Around 50.

339
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,246
And would it be fair to say, sir, 

340
00:17:16,246 --> 00:17:19,594
that you are primarily hired by these types of plaintiff law firm?

341
00:17:19,594 --> 00:17:20,548
Objection!

342
00:17:20,548 --> 00:17:21,687
Sustained.

343
00:17:21,687 --> 00:17:25,742
Let me rephrase: you’ve been hired by this law firm before, 

344
00:17:25,742 --> 00:17:26,326
haven’t you, sir?

345
00:17:26,326 --> 00:17:27,751
Objection! What’s the relevance?

346
00:17:27,751 --> 00:17:29,170
It goes to bias, Your Honour. 

347
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:32,367
He’s been hired in the past and will be hired in the future.

348
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:36,072
This witness has incentive to satisfy personal injury law firm.

349
00:17:36,072 --> 00:17:38,114
Objection! Move to strike that.

350
00:17:38,114 --> 00:17:40,541
I am gonna overrule the objection. 

351
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,963
But I am closing the door on this line of questioning.

352
00:17:44,973 --> 00:17:46,633
In that case I am done, Your Honour.

353
00:18:08,022 --> 00:18:10,418
You know what’s going on, he’s putting us on trial. 

354
00:18:10,418 --> 00:18:14,120
He wants the jury to associate this case with you and me.

355
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:21,686
All I can tell you this time 

356
00:18:21,686 --> 00:18:23,698
is that the suspect passed the psychiatric exam

357
00:18:23,698 --> 00:18:25,371
which means he’s competent to stand trial.

358
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:26,653
Was the baseball bat found…

359
00:18:26,653 --> 00:18:28,524
I am not gonna comment on the evidence at this time. 

360
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,759
When there is further developments, I will keep you apprised.

361
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,495
Were you surprised that this case's assigned to you 

362
00:18:32,495 --> 00:18:35,484
after so many recent high profile flops?

363
00:18:37,353 --> 00:18:41,495
There is no strategy here, just speak from the heart.

364
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:46,466
Okay, will I have to get into the…er…

365
00:18:47,114 --> 00:18:50,197
Bugs. You might.

366
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:52,922
You may have to open yourself up in there, Henry.

367
00:18:52,922 --> 00:18:56,148
Our only chance is with the Judge believes you.

368
00:18:56,148 --> 00:18:58,332
If he thinks you are hiding anything…

369
00:18:58,332 --> 00:18:59,076
Okay.

370
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:04,032
Should Allison be there?

371
00:19:04,906 --> 00:19:06,342
It couldn’t hurt.

372
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:13,443
Everything was going fine and then suddenly 

373
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,256
his blood pressure just plunged

374
00:19:15,256 --> 00:19:16,337
Did you know why?

375
00:19:16,337 --> 00:19:19,698
No. there is always a risk in any surgery. 

376
00:19:19,698 --> 00:19:22,436
I do know we didn’t over load fluid.

377
00:19:22,436 --> 00:19:26,223
When Mr. Riley’s heart went into arrest, what did you do?

378
00:19:26,223 --> 00:19:29,292
We massaged the chest, brought in the defibrillator, 

379
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:30,663
started the heart again; 

380
00:19:30,663 --> 00:19:32,235
but then it stopped.

381
00:19:32,235 --> 00:19:33,833
We wheeled in a crash cart. 

382
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,473
Contradict to Dr. Willis’assertion

383
00:19:35,473 --> 00:19:38,848
we did have the technology to respond to this crisis.

384
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:43,671
Dr. Stiles, Mr. Riley did die on your table.

385
00:19:43,671 --> 00:19:45,413
I know. 

386
00:19:45,413 --> 00:19:48,525
And it was devastating for all of us. 

387
00:19:48,525 --> 00:19:53,638
But death is a risk in every surgery.

388
00:19:53,638 --> 00:20:00,009
Sometimes whether it would be heart failure or reaction of anesthesia,

389
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:03,418
unforeseen circumstances take a life.

390
00:20:03,418 --> 00:20:07,710
All I can assure you of, as I’ve assured Mrs. Riley,

391
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:11,732
is that everything was done right in that room.

392
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:14,709
This is not a death due to doctor error.

393
00:20:17,392 --> 00:20:19,543
Did you have a cardiopathic surgeon?

394
00:20:19,543 --> 00:20:21,143
I beg your pardon.

395
00:20:21,143 --> 00:20:23,927
Did you have a cardiopathic surgeon?

396
00:20:23,927 --> 00:20:27,394
Somebody who could open up the patient’s chest, ** the heart; 

397
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,090
maybe put him on bypass either.

398
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,165
Did you have such a doctor in your office?

399
00:20:31,165 --> 00:20:32,089
No.

400
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:33,921
A hospital would have, right?

401
00:20:34,993 --> 00:20:37,526
How long have you been preforming lipo suction, sir?

402
00:20:37,526 --> 00:20:39,743
I’ve been doing it for about two years.

403
00:20:39,743 --> 00:20:41,065
You are a cosmetic surgeon 

404
00:20:41,065 --> 00:20:43,439
who specialize on face reconstruction, aren’t you?

405
00:20:43,439 --> 00:20:46,838
If you are suggesting that I am not qualified to do the procedure…

406
00:20:46,838 --> 00:20:48,862
I am suggesting this isn’t your specialty.

407
00:20:48,862 --> 00:20:50,636
I am suggesting that up until two years ago 

408
00:20:50,636 --> 00:20:52,544
you worked on faces and burnt victims 

409
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:54,510
but you didn’t do lipo suction, isn’t that correct?

410
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:57,170
I am sorry. I have to object to this assault.

411
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,218
This is an assault?

412
00:20:58,218 --> 00:21:01,671
Your Honour, I have a personal affection to Mr. Young, 

413
00:21:01,671 --> 00:21:03,318
I think he is a fine attorney.

414
00:21:03,318 --> 00:21:06,246
But perhaps I'll remind that this is a civil trial.

415
00:21:06,246 --> 00:21:06,771
Your Honour.

416
00:21:06,771 --> 00:21:09,592
Never mind. I am overruling the objection. 

417
00:21:09,592 --> 00:21:11,213
Mr. Young, proceed.

418
00:21:11,213 --> 00:21:14,094
You sucked out 22 pounds of fat, didn’t you, doctor?

419
00:21:14,094 --> 00:21:15,118
Yes.

420
00:21:15,118 --> 00:21:17,255
You are aware that’s more than what’s considered to be safe.

421
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:20,237
You can’t quantify safety with statistics. 

422
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,091
It’s done on a case by case basis 

423
00:21:22,091 --> 00:21:24,356
and in this case, I felt it was safe.

424
00:21:24,356 --> 00:21:25,858
And he died.

425
00:21:25,858 --> 00:21:28,102
Not because I took out too much fat.

426
00:21:28,102 --> 00:21:29,703
Well… as I understand it 

427
00:21:29,703 --> 00:21:31,394
the more fat you suction out 

428
00:21:31,394 --> 00:21:33,388
the more trauma to the body, is that correct?

429
00:21:33,388 --> 00:21:33,817
Yes.

430
00:21:33,817 --> 00:21:35,100
And the more lidocaine need to…

431
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,313
This patient did not died from a lidocaine over dose.

432
00:21:38,313 --> 00:21:39,809
You know that to a medical certainty?

433
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:42,717
As I said, you can never know anything to a medical certainty.

434
00:21:42,717 --> 00:21:44,387
Then why are you saying it with a certainty?

435
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:44,964
Objection!

436
00:21:44,964 --> 00:21:45,677
Withdrawn.

437
00:21:45,677 --> 00:21:47,780
How much do you charge for this kind of procedure?

438
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,977
I charged Mr. Riley $8,000.

439
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:52,474
That is upfront, right? No insurance to deal with?

440
00:21:52,474 --> 00:21:53,642
How is this relevant?

441
00:21:53,642 --> 00:21:55,198
It is relevant because you are in the business 

442
00:21:55,198 --> 00:21:56,658
of sucking fat out of people without any concern…

443
00:21:56,658 --> 00:21:57,554
Objection!

444
00:21:57,554 --> 00:21:59,850
You could save your personal affection, Mr. Bradford.

445
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:00,850
All right.

446
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:03,647
This is a court of law, not a street fight.

447
00:22:03,647 --> 00:22:04,294
What did you say?

448
00:22:04,294 --> 00:22:05,738
That’s enough.

449
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:13,490
Your Honour, I apologize both to you and the jury 

450
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:17,420
for this unnecessary acrimony.

451
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:23,670
Mr. Young, return your attention to the witness, please.

452
00:22:26,508 --> 00:22:28,093
Mr. Olson, 

453
00:22:28,585 --> 00:22:33,923
at trial you said when you came out of your office

454
00:22:33,923 --> 00:22:35,698
you found the woman dead, 

455
00:22:36,117 --> 00:22:38,198
did you see anything else?

456
00:22:38,198 --> 00:22:39,182
Yes.

457
00:22:39,182 --> 00:22:43,540
I saw my son Steven, he was leaving.

458
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,325
Your son Steven.

459
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,367
Yes.

460
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:48,989
But you never told anybody.

461
00:22:48,989 --> 00:22:52,554
I told you deep into the trial 

462
00:22:53,454 --> 00:22:56,451
only because you were going to accuse my wife.

463
00:22:56,451 --> 00:22:58,324
Why did you keep this secret?

464
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:04,251
He had his whole life ahead of him, Your honour. 

465
00:23:04,805 --> 00:23:06,214
Me?

466
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,285
I am… 

467
00:23:09,883 --> 00:23:13,341
I was a perverted deviant 

468
00:23:13,341 --> 00:23:16,765
who like to watch women step on bugs.

469
00:23:17,976 --> 00:23:22,370
I am the reason that he committed this crime. 

470
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,598
I drove him to commit this crime.

471
00:23:25,743 --> 00:23:29,677
He'd heard his mother and me arguing about my fetish.

472
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:36,355
My attorneys told me that I had a chance of winning a trial.

473
00:23:36,355 --> 00:23:40,962
So I took the chance, figuring if I could get out of prison 

474
00:23:42,207 --> 00:23:45,140
I could get Steven some help.

475
00:23:53,568 --> 00:23:55,160
Why should we believe you?

476
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,539
Because I am telling the truth.

477
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:00,720
Now your son is dead, he can’t defend himself to this charges.

478
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,650
I told Mr. Berluti before he was dead.

479
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,001
Even if you did, 

480
00:24:05,001 --> 00:24:08,492
all of this coincides with your motive to be cleared of this crime.

481
00:24:08,492 --> 00:24:11,645
And all we have is your word here, 

482
00:24:11,645 --> 00:24:13,495
isn’t that right, Mr. Olson?

483
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:16,423
You lied to you wife about this bug thing, 

484
00:24:16,423 --> 00:24:18,868
you kept the truth from your own attorneys 

485
00:24:18,868 --> 00:24:21,252
that is if the state of this version is the truth.

486
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:24,336
We have a conviction here supported by evidence,

487
00:24:24,336 --> 00:24:28,172
would you trying to overturn with nothing but your word of honour?

488
00:24:28,172 --> 00:24:30,946
And my affidavit.

489
00:24:30,946 --> 00:24:34,187
I accused the son Steven of killing this woman.

490
00:24:34,187 --> 00:24:38,869
He didn’t deny it, instead he goes home and kills himself.

491
00:24:38,869 --> 00:24:41,820
We have a tremendous injustice here.

492
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:47,081
An innocent man is sitting in jail for a crime he didn’t commit.

493
00:24:47,081 --> 00:24:51,014
We can just sit back and say too late, game is over. 

494
00:24:51,014 --> 00:24:53,405
It’s not too late.

495
00:24:53,405 --> 00:24:57,934
There he still sits, it’s not too late.

496
00:24:57,934 --> 00:25:02,718
We all say better to let ten guilty men go free 

497
00:25:02,718 --> 00:25:06,103
than send one innocent man to jail.

498
00:25:06,103 --> 00:25:09,940
And still he sits in prison innocent.

499
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:13,777
He didn’t kill that woman.

500
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,715
Mr. Berluti, I am impressed with your passion 

501
00:25:17,715 --> 00:25:20,418
and I don’t dismiss the value of your affidavit 

502
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:23,667
but still we have a process here.

503
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:26,231
The jury listened to every witness, 

504
00:25:26,231 --> 00:25:29,164
they deliberated it and they returned a verdict.

505
00:25:29,164 --> 00:25:30,624
And I certainly have to have 

506
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:33,351
more than the defendant’s word and the attorney’s word 

507
00:25:33,351 --> 00:25:34,768
that he’s innocent.

508
00:25:34,768 --> 00:25:38,680
Otherwise I would be making a mockery of the jury system altogether.

509
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:43,606
It's one thing if the DA was coming forward with you 

510
00:25:43,606 --> 00:25:45,806
saying an injustice has been done.

511
00:25:45,806 --> 00:25:47,201
But here, 

512
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,519
all I have is you;

513
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:55,052
the man’s lawyer, the man’s friend,

514
00:25:55,052 --> 00:25:57,439
protesting his innocence.

515
00:25:59,311 --> 00:26:02,570
The conviction stands. Adjourned.

516
00:26:30,993 --> 00:26:32,487
Come on, Jimmy.

517
00:26:40,138 --> 00:26:42,001
I think we should call him on it. 

518
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:43,315
How can we just sit back…

519
00:26:43,315 --> 00:26:44,973
We stick to the case, Rebecca.

520
00:26:44,973 --> 00:26:47,257
Well he’s not, you know he’s not.

521
00:26:47,257 --> 00:26:50,952
We play any other card at this point, we just looked desperate.

522
00:26:50,952 --> 00:26:53,325
We stick to the merit of the case.

523
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:11,420
You are wasting your time, Jimmy. 

524
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,965
What? You think you can liquoring me up…

525
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:17,728
Suppose I deliver the Rabbi killer, murder two.

526
00:27:19,987 --> 00:27:23,892
Clyde Miller for Henry Olson, straight out.

527
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:28,628
First of all, what you are proposing is so unethical.

528
00:27:28,628 --> 00:27:30,270
Which is why I never proposed.

529
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:34,102
Second, I don’t need any favors on Miller, we got the guy.

530
00:27:34,102 --> 00:27:35,260
No, you don’t, Richard.

531
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:38,309
Prints on the bat, Rabbi’s DNA all over…

532
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:42,333
Well he found the Rabbi dead in the alley, decided to rob him.

533
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:43,837
Is that his story?

534
00:27:43,837 --> 00:27:44,669
Could be.

535
00:27:44,995 --> 00:27:47,351
And you can’t completely disprove it.

536
00:27:47,351 --> 00:27:49,174
The guy’s got an assault record as long as…

537
00:27:49,174 --> 00:27:51,779
Yeah, history of mugging not killing.

538
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:54,622
All we need is one lone juror. 

539
00:27:54,622 --> 00:27:58,141
High profile case, public outrage.

540
00:27:58,141 --> 00:28:00,127
You lose this one, Richard. 

541
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:03,809
I know you don’t wanna think about that.

542
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:05,547
I won’t lose it, Jimmy. 

543
00:28:05,547 --> 00:28:07,931
Save your breath trying to intimidate me.

544
00:28:07,931 --> 00:28:12,135
I got an innocent man and a way to make things easy for you.

545
00:28:12,135 --> 00:28:16,452
It’s win-win, justice-justice.

546
00:28:20,104 --> 00:28:25,923
If, I say if, Olson passes a polygraph, 

547
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:30,291
I will consider a joined recommendation to the court.

548
00:28:35,358 --> 00:28:37,642
On a completely unrelated matter

549
00:28:37,642 --> 00:28:40,024
I am offering Clyde Miller murder two.

550
00:28:52,142 --> 00:28:54,856
Res Ipsa Loquitor, 

551
00:28:54,856 --> 00:28:57,898
that’s a Latin term which basically means 

552
00:28:57,898 --> 00:29:00,647
what happened speaks for itself.

553
00:29:00,647 --> 00:29:03,089
And that’s what we have here.

554
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:07,052
That man was an exclusive controller of the situation.

555
00:29:07,052 --> 00:29:11,585
The patient died in a procedure where injury does not normally occur.

556
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:14,564
After going into a lipo suction, a procedure so simple, 

557
00:29:14,564 --> 00:29:15,871
dentists are now doing it, 

558
00:29:15,871 --> 00:29:18,679
he came out dead and the doctor’s response is 

559
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:21,219
sometimes it happens, patients die.

560
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:23,112
And you know why he died, ladies and gentlemen?

561
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:25,884
Money. Money.

562
00:29:25,884 --> 00:29:27,784
With HMOs cutting costs, 

563
00:29:27,784 --> 00:29:30,001
with hospital slashing doctor salaries, 

564
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:33,046
surgeons are turning to cosmetic surgery to hit their pools.

565
00:29:33,046 --> 00:29:35,214
Forget having to wait for insurance reimbursements 

566
00:29:35,214 --> 00:29:38,159
these procedures aren’t covered by insurance.

567
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,069
The money is upfront. 

568
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:42,591
6, 7, 8 thousand dollars out of pop for lipo suction.

569
00:29:42,591 --> 00:29:44,373
We are talking about cash, people.

570
00:29:44,373 --> 00:29:46,215
And they do it right in their offices, 

571
00:29:46,215 --> 00:29:49,165
coz you start cutting profits when you do it in a hospital 

572
00:29:49,165 --> 00:29:53,187
which is okay when things go right I guess.

573
00:29:53,187 --> 00:29:54,967
But when things go wrong, 

574
00:29:56,002 --> 00:30:00,564
Moris Riley, death.

575
00:30:04,045 --> 00:30:09,200
He took out 22 pounds of fat, too much by medical standards.

576
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,763
He had to load him with extra lidocaine in order to do it.

577
00:30:11,763 --> 00:30:14,407
Lidocaine, a drug to slow the pulse, 

578
00:30:14,407 --> 00:30:16,286
a drug that affects the heart.

579
00:30:16,286 --> 00:30:17,724
And he did it in his office 

580
00:30:17,724 --> 00:30:21,139
with no cardiologist and no cardiopathic surgeon in the building 

581
00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:23,220
they should have been done in a hospital.

582
00:30:23,511 --> 00:30:25,807
Something went terribly wrong.

583
00:30:25,807 --> 00:30:28,980
Simple procedure, patient dies, 

584
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,487
something went terribly wrong.

585
00:30:33,328 --> 00:30:37,415
Res Ipsa Loquitor.

586
00:30:40,502 --> 00:30:43,708
Murder two? Isn’t that like life?

587
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:46,088
It is, but with parole maybe. 

588
00:30:46,088 --> 00:30:49,853
If you go down on murder one, forget it.

589
00:30:49,853 --> 00:30:51,350
And you don’t think that we could beat it? 

590
00:30:52,176 --> 00:30:53,828
OJ, he beat it.

591
00:30:53,828 --> 00:30:57,261
Honest, we could take the shot, 

592
00:30:57,261 --> 00:30:58,736
but I don’t think we would win, 

593
00:30:58,736 --> 00:31:01,644
in which case you are looking at murder one.

594
00:31:01,644 --> 00:31:07,443
I think if we can make this go away quiet with murder two, 

595
00:31:07,652 --> 00:31:10,193
you would be crazy not to take it.

596
00:31:18,881 --> 00:31:21,735
Never mind there is been no negligence, 

597
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:25,309
never mind nobody did anything wrong, 

598
00:31:25,309 --> 00:31:26,544
go to court 

599
00:31:26,544 --> 00:31:30,073
roll the dice and hope for a jackpot.

600
00:31:30,576 --> 00:31:32,506
Didn’t used to be this way.

601
00:31:32,506 --> 00:31:35,423
But with the proliferation of law schools 

602
00:31:35,423 --> 00:31:38,278
and the lowering of the bar if you will 

603
00:31:39,072 --> 00:31:41,372
we have a glut of attorneys

604
00:31:41,372 --> 00:31:44,614
and a resulting boom of litigations to feed them.

605
00:31:44,614 --> 00:31:50,808
Accordingly, you can always find a lawyer to take your case today, 

606
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:56,602
and Mrs. Riley found two very capable ones to take hers, didn’t she?

607
00:31:56,602 --> 00:32:01,678
The problem is she has no evidence 

608
00:32:01,678 --> 00:32:06,374
to establish any wrong doing by Doctor Stiles.

609
00:32:06,374 --> 00:32:10,440
But we had an unfortunate result.

610
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:15,822
And therefore we are automatically leaping to negligence.

611
00:32:15,822 --> 00:32:18,581
Mr. Young even admitted this much, didn’t he?

612
00:32:18,581 --> 00:32:25,016
When he stood up here saying Res Ipsa Loquitor, let’s presume it.

613
00:32:25,857 --> 00:32:32,401
I have compassion for Mr. Riley’s pani as I am sure you do.

614
00:32:32,401 --> 00:32:37,558
Her husband’s heart gave out as hearts sometimes do.

615
00:32:38,592 --> 00:32:41,473
There is a tragedy here, no question.

616
00:32:41,985 --> 00:32:46,757
But there is no malpractice.

617
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:56,825
Mr. Young, rebuttal?

618
00:33:00,815 --> 00:33:06,725
Whether there is malpractice or not, that is your decision.

619
00:33:06,725 --> 00:33:10,562
But I hope you don’t think less of Mrs. Riley’s cause of action 

620
00:33:10,562 --> 00:33:13,502
because of the lawyers she found to represent her.

621
00:33:13,502 --> 00:33:15,142
Don’t get me wrong, 

622
00:33:15,142 --> 00:33:18,842
like Mr. Bradford said, we are capable attorneys,

623
00:33:18,842 --> 00:33:21,485
I think we are even a credit to our profession.

624
00:33:21,485 --> 00:33:25,002
But let’s face it, we are not the best.

625
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:28,135
We’ve come a long way, we’ve made some progress 

626
00:33:28,135 --> 00:33:31,396
but we are just not the first choice, are we?

627
00:33:31,396 --> 00:33:32,526
What’s going on here?

628
00:33:32,526 --> 00:33:36,883
What’s going on with the proliferation of law schools 

629
00:33:36,883 --> 00:33:38,727
and the lowering of the bar 

630
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:43,132
and more and more attorneys like us are finding our way into this room, 

631
00:33:43,132 --> 00:33:45,401
I am agree with you, Mr. Bradford.

632
00:33:45,401 --> 00:33:47,819
Counsel, if you are not gonna argue the evidence 

633
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:49,596
I will ask you to return to your seat.

634
00:33:49,596 --> 00:33:53,799
Mr. Young and I are very much in evidence, Your Honour.

635
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:57,743
Mr. Bradford put us in evidence.

636
00:33:57,743 --> 00:34:01,676
He asked Mrs. Riley who first told her there was negligence, 

637
00:34:01,676 --> 00:34:04,590
was it a doctor or was it your lawyer.

638
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,673
He asked how many law firms did you visited 

639
00:34:06,673 --> 00:34:10,114
before you found the attorney willing to take your case.

640
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:12,071
He asked our expert witness 

641
00:34:12,071 --> 00:34:16,381
if he was regularly hired by these types of plaintiff law firms.

642
00:34:17,238 --> 00:34:21,180
He announces his personal affection for Mr. Young 

643
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:24,072
and then reminds him this isn’t a street fight.

644
00:34:25,035 --> 00:34:27,693
We are very much in evidence, Your Honour, 

645
00:34:27,693 --> 00:34:28,794
and I don’t like it.

646
00:34:29,748 --> 00:34:31,396
I don’t like it one bit.

647
00:34:31,396 --> 00:34:33,694
Ms. Washington, I will ask you once again 

648
00:34:33,694 --> 00:34:36,850
please confine your remarks to the case.

649
00:34:37,936 --> 00:34:45,857
Wife saves up money to give her husband a lipo suction procedure.

650
00:34:45,857 --> 00:34:50,000
They go to a doctor, doctor preforms procedure, 

651
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,591
husband dies.

652
00:34:52,772 --> 00:34:55,066
That’s a pretty good case.

653
00:34:55,066 --> 00:34:57,412
Imagine how strong it would be 

654
00:34:57,412 --> 00:35:01,801
if Mrs. Riley had found the right kind of lawyers.

655
00:35:16,241 --> 00:35:17,602
I didn’t do anything.

656
00:35:17,602 --> 00:35:18,432
Where is Jimmy?

657
00:35:18,432 --> 00:35:19,246
Right here. what’s…

658
00:35:19,246 --> 00:35:22,593
You signed off on murder two with Clyde Miller, just like that?

659
00:35:22,593 --> 00:35:24,975
We had to take it or leave it, onetime offer.

660
00:35:24,975 --> 00:35:25,890
So, why did you take it?

661
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,676
Because he was looking at first degree…

662
00:35:27,676 --> 00:35:29,225
We're still gonna trial the thing?.

663
00:35:29,225 --> 00:35:29,935
And lost.

664
00:35:29,935 --> 00:35:31,559
But maybe won, their evidence…

665
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:32,707
Oh, please.

666
00:35:32,707 --> 00:35:34,800
Jimmy, there were no witnesses. 

667
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,296
I’ve just beaten a much tougher case 

668
00:35:36,296 --> 00:35:38,050
than this one a month ago with Darrel Hutchins.

669
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:38,775
What’s going on?

670
00:35:38,775 --> 00:35:41,276
Clyde Miller, he just coped to second degree.

671
00:35:41,276 --> 00:35:43,261
There were no rabbits to pull on this one, Ellenor, 

672
00:35:43,261 --> 00:35:44,729
they had him dead to centre.

673
00:35:44,729 --> 00:35:45,778
Even so, Jimmy, 

674
00:35:45,778 --> 00:35:48,885
that seems a little rush and since I am second chair 

675
00:35:48,885 --> 00:35:50,553
I think you could’ve run this by me before you...

676
00:35:50,553 --> 00:35:52,473
I didn’t think you really wanted to be bothered.

677
00:35:53,427 --> 00:35:56,285
Good news. Henry passed the polygraph.

678
00:35:56,285 --> 00:35:57,011
He did?

679
00:35:57,011 --> 00:35:59,142
Yes. They are transferring him to the court house.

680
00:35:59,878 --> 00:36:01,766
What’s he taking a polygraph for?

681
00:36:01,766 --> 00:36:03,754
Richard Bay, I worked him up last night 

682
00:36:03,754 --> 00:36:06,916
he said if Henry passed a lie detector, he'd then do us a release.

683
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:08,808
Bay’s gonna recommend a release now?

684
00:36:08,808 --> 00:36:10,740
He said a polygraph would **.

685
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,643
Richard Bay is the DA on Clyde Miller.

686
00:36:21,885 --> 00:36:23,366
Oh my god.

687
00:36:23,366 --> 00:36:24,547
Tell me.

688
00:36:24,547 --> 00:36:25,482
In my office.

689
00:36:25,482 --> 00:36:26,438
I can’t.

690
00:36:26,438 --> 00:36:27,945
They are transferring Henry back to the court house.

691
00:36:27,945 --> 00:36:29,769
In my office.

692
00:36:36,043 --> 00:36:38,383
Your served up Miller to get Henry out?

693
00:36:38,383 --> 00:36:39,379
I made independent deals.

694
00:36:39,379 --> 00:36:40,510
Don’t screw with me, Jimmy.

695
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,762
I made separate deals for two…

696
00:36:41,762 --> 00:36:43,370
You don’t just cop to murder two.

697
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:45,795
-Judgment call and don’t tell me you’ve never done it,  -You could get disbar.

698
00:36:45,795 --> 00:36:47,146
I know you’ve done it.

699
00:36:47,146 --> 00:36:48,047
I am talking here.

700
00:36:48,047 --> 00:36:49,730
And I am not listening, shut up.

701
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,090
Don’t you… 

702
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:55,244
don’t you dare put yourself in my position,

703
00:36:55,244 --> 00:36:57,866
a man isn’t jail coz of you.

704
00:36:57,866 --> 00:37:01,603
A kid didn’t put a noose around his neck coz of you.

705
00:37:01,603 --> 00:37:03,369
You are falling apart.

706
00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:05,222
Of course I am falling apart. 

707
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:07,845
I’ve been falling apart for three months. I…

708
00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:11,120
I gotta fix this, Bobby.

709
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,900
I won’t let you.

710
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,478
You just stay the hell out of it.

711
00:37:13,478 --> 00:37:16,555
I can’t. Clyde Miller is a client of this firm.

712
00:37:16,555 --> 00:37:18,463
I explained it to him, he took it.

713
00:37:18,463 --> 00:37:20,095
He’s stupid. He’ll do whatever you say.

714
00:37:20,095 --> 00:37:22,899
You keep out of it. You wanna fire me, fire me.

715
00:37:22,899 --> 00:37:24,940
But I gotta fix this.

716
00:37:31,401 --> 00:37:34,516
He’s a killer. He killed a Rabbi. 

717
00:37:34,516 --> 00:37:36,358
He should be in jail.

718
00:37:36,358 --> 00:37:39,127
Henry Olson shouldn’t be. 

719
00:37:39,802 --> 00:37:42,021
This is a just result.

720
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,671
It doesn’t work like that, Jimmy.

721
00:37:47,736 --> 00:37:54,612
Please, two separate deals, two different cases.

722
00:37:54,612 --> 00:38:00,707
He'd go down on murder one if we try it, just let this be.

723
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:09,411
Just let this be.

724
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:24,152
How long would it take?

725
00:38:26,746 --> 00:38:28,833
It could take some time.

726
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:31,177
They first have to decide on liability, 

727
00:38:31,177 --> 00:38:35,345
if they find him negligent then they go to damages.

728
00:38:35,345 --> 00:38:37,625
It could take some time.

729
00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:52,519
You angry?

730
00:38:54,859 --> 00:38:56,963
I just don’t know that you'd help, Rebecca.

731
00:38:56,963 --> 00:39:01,139
It was in the air, I wasn’t playing cards, I promise.

732
00:39:04,431 --> 00:39:06,871
I just had to clear some air.

733
00:39:26,258 --> 00:39:28,180
This is way too fast.

734
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,900
Tell me about it.

735
00:39:36,729 --> 00:39:39,731
Mr. Foreman, the jury has reached a verdict?

736
00:39:39,731 --> 00:39:41,102
We have, Your Honour.

737
00:39:41,102 --> 00:39:41,981
What say you?

738
00:39:42,675 --> 00:39:46,117
On question one: do we find the defendant negligent?

739
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:47,516
We, the jury, answer: 

740
00:39:47,516 --> 00:39:48,326
yes.

741
00:39:49,477 --> 00:39:51,169
On question two: 

742
00:39:51,169 --> 00:39:52,696
do we find the defendant’s negligence 

743
00:39:52,696 --> 00:39:55,434
to be the proximate cause of Moris Riley’s death?

744
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:56,952
We, the jury, answer: 

745
00:39:56,952 --> 00:39:57,976
yes.

746
00:40:00,488 --> 00:40:03,658
We further order the defendant to pay damages to the plaintiff 

747
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,349
in the amount of 6 million dollars.

748
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,476
Did he say… 

749
00:40:11,834 --> 00:40:13,065
what did he say?

750
00:40:13,065 --> 00:40:15,418
He sure didn’t say 32 thousand.

751
00:40:15,418 --> 00:40:16,881
Six million?

752
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:23,417
Your Honour, we move for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict 

753
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:25,306
and ask it would be put aside. 

754
00:40:25,306 --> 00:40:26,868
Denied.

755
00:40:26,868 --> 00:40:28,519
This matter is adjourned.

756
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:31,231
Members of the jury, thank you for your service.

757
00:40:35,659 --> 00:40:38,738
Mr. Bay, I must say I didn’t expect this.

758
00:40:38,738 --> 00:40:42,683
Your Honour, Mr. Berluti’s verified affidavit, the boy’s suicide. 

759
00:40:42,683 --> 00:40:45,951
I have to admit it gives me serious pause.

760
00:40:45,951 --> 00:40:50,089
Then this morning Mr. Olson took a polygraph which he passed 

761
00:40:50,089 --> 00:40:52,213
though that’s not legally admissible, 

762
00:40:52,213 --> 00:40:54,208
it should certainly be deemed reliable 

763
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:58,317
and well the Commonwealth no longer believes he committed the crime.

764
00:40:58,317 --> 00:41:01,208
At the minimum he should be granted a new trial.

765
00:41:01,904 --> 00:41:03,575
Oh, if he is granted a new trial, 

766
00:41:03,575 --> 00:41:05,505
will the Commonwealth pursue it?

767
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:06,435
No, Your Honour.

768
00:41:06,435 --> 00:41:08,873
We couldn’t proceeding good faith at this point.

769
00:41:08,873 --> 00:41:11,915
Well, then I am certainly not gonna waste anybody’s time.

770
00:41:13,466 --> 00:41:15,571
Mr. Olson, you are a free man, 

771
00:41:15,571 --> 00:41:18,759
the conviction is set aside, you can go.

772
00:41:28,822 --> 00:41:32,141
Jimmy, thank you, thank you.

773
00:41:38,992 --> 00:41:40,671
Thank you.
