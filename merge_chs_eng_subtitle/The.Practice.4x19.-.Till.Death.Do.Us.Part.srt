00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,095
Previous on The Practice:

2
00:00:02,095 --> 00:00:04,786
Can you tell me the crime your son’s been convicted of?

3
00:00:04,786 --> 00:00:06,772
He’s on death row in Pennsylvania.

4
00:00:06,772 --> 00:00:08,922
He’s to be executed in five weeks.

5
00:00:08,922 --> 00:00:12,722
He’s convicted of raping and killing his girlfriend, Alisha Kerns, 

6
00:00:12,722 --> 00:00:13,877
then killing her mother.

7
00:00:13,877 --> 00:00:15,014
Any DNA?

8
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:17,835
They didn’t do full DNA analysis back then.

9
00:00:17,835 --> 00:00:19,756
This is Ellenor Frutt.

10
00:00:19,756 --> 00:00:20,360
Hello.

11
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,584
She says you can do something, can you really?

12
00:00:23,127 --> 00:00:24,684
Would you support me in my efforts 

13
00:00:24,684 --> 00:00:26,774
to try to determine where the rape kit could have gone? 

14
00:00:26,774 --> 00:00:28,402
Of course, but Ms. Frutt, 

15
00:00:28,402 --> 00:00:30,776
Mr. Donovan was rightly convicted. 

16
00:00:30,776 --> 00:00:33,531
-of a double homicide..-He did not commit that crime.

17
00:00:33,531 --> 00:00:34,183
All right. 

18
00:00:34,183 --> 00:00:36,422
Steven, Alisha?

19
00:00:36,422 --> 00:00:37,501
Yes, that's it,  Alisha.

20
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:38,716
32665.

21
00:00:38,716 --> 00:00:40,436
Yeah, that's the file number. 

22
00:00:40,684 --> 00:00:41,416
We've got it. 

23
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,322
New evidence is one thing, 

24
00:00:43,322 --> 00:00:47,805
but the reevaluation of old evidence is quite another. 

25
00:00:47,805 --> 00:00:51,263
I'm only asking that you authorize a DNA test. 

26
00:00:51,263 --> 00:00:52,660
The petition is denied. 

27
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,752
She just doesn't know when to quit. 

28
00:00:54,752 --> 00:00:57,545
Well, I guess she and I have something in common then, 

29
00:00:57,545 --> 00:00:59,440
because I'm not quitting. 

30
00:01:03,634 --> 00:01:07,821
Okay. Pennsylvania Supreme Court turned us down last night, 

31
00:01:07,821 --> 00:01:10,011
which means we have to go to Federal Circuit Court 

32
00:01:10,011 --> 00:01:12,583
under what's called a Successor Petition. 

33
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:14,321
Just to get the DNA test? 

34
00:01:14,321 --> 00:01:16,252
It gets worse. 

35
00:01:17,088 --> 00:01:20,878
Since his last lawyer previously filed a Habeas Petition, 

36
00:01:20,878 --> 00:01:23,367
under federal law we don't get another chance 

37
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:25,749
unless we can pretty much prove that he's innocent, 

38
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:29,605
and that his constitutional rights were violated. 

39
00:01:29,605 --> 00:01:30,304
Wait, wait, wait. 

40
00:01:30,304 --> 00:01:31,962
We're trying to get the DNA test 

41
00:01:31,962 --> 00:01:33,508
in order to prove that he's innocent, 

42
00:01:33,508 --> 00:01:34,811
but we can't get that test 

43
00:01:34,811 --> 00:01:37,068
unless we prove he's innocent first? 

44
00:01:37,068 --> 00:01:38,391
Right. 

45
00:01:38,391 --> 00:01:39,573
How the hell can that be?! 

46
00:01:39,573 --> 00:01:40,397
I don't know, 

47
00:01:40,397 --> 00:01:43,932
but Stuart Donovan is set to be put to death in 17 days, 

48
00:01:43,932 --> 00:01:45,773
so that means between now and then 

49
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:49,244
we have to somehow prove that he's innocent.

52
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,514
Excuse me.

53
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:43,389
Are you Mr. Donnell? 

54
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:44,080
Yes 

55
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,918
My name's Arthur Turner and this is my wife Gertrude. 

56
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:48,693
Hello. 

57
00:02:48,693 --> 00:02:51,216
I'm afraid we're in a bit of trouble. 

58
00:02:51,216 --> 00:02:53,018
What kind of trouble? 

59
00:02:53,018 --> 00:02:54,649
It's my daughter. 

60
00:02:54,649 --> 00:02:55,695
We were recently married 

61
00:02:55,695 --> 00:02:58,332
and my stepdaughter's trying to get the marriage annulled. 

62
00:02:58,332 --> 00:03:00,198
There's a hearing scheduled for today... 

63
00:03:00,198 --> 00:03:01,897
Mr. Turner, this is Lindsay Dole. 

64
00:03:01,897 --> 00:03:04,355
She heads up our domestic relations department. 

65
00:03:04,355 --> 00:03:06,872
Lindsay, this is Arthur Turner and his wife Gertrude. 

66
00:03:06,872 --> 00:03:07,499
Hello. 

67
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:09,347
Bobby, on that lujack matter... 

68
00:03:09,347 --> 00:03:10,741
I'll handle the lujack deposition. 

69
00:03:10,741 --> 00:03:12,060
Help the Turners. 

70
00:03:12,614 --> 00:03:15,104
If they are able to get this annulled, 

71
00:03:15,104 --> 00:03:16,698
which they are trying to do... 

72
00:03:16,698 --> 00:03:17,260
Rebecca. 

73
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,281
Actually sir, we have an annulment specialist. 

74
00:03:19,281 --> 00:03:20,422
Could you help the Turners? 

75
00:03:20,422 --> 00:03:22,103
Their marriage is being threatened with annulment. 

76
00:03:22,103 --> 00:03:23,047
The hearing is today. 

77
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:24,362
I have that lujack conflict... 

78
00:03:24,362 --> 00:03:27,235
I'm actually helping Bobby on the lujack matter. 

79
00:03:27,235 --> 00:03:28,213
Thank you. 

80
00:03:28,213 --> 00:03:29,616
Ms. Washington will help you.  

81
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:35,731
This lujack sounds like a really big client. 

82
00:03:44,377 --> 00:03:46,653
I can't possibly thank you enough for coming. 

83
00:03:46,653 --> 00:03:48,176
Come on, I'll show you the room. 

84
00:03:48,176 --> 00:03:49,635
We can get started. 

85
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,117
Oh my god. 

86
00:04:04,117 --> 00:04:06,219
Oh, sorry. 

87
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:08,705
I don't even notice those anymore. 

88
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:10,481
After 12 years... 

89
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:12,401
I have a meeting with the informant at one. 

90
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:14,211
Eugene's gonna see the eyewitness. 

91
00:04:14,211 --> 00:04:16,540
Good luck tying to get the time of day with him. 

92
00:04:17,473 --> 00:04:18,564
What about the father? 

93
00:04:18,564 --> 00:04:20,368
Jimmy is gonna try. 

94
00:04:20,368 --> 00:04:23,047
I can't tell you how grateful I am. 

95
00:04:23,047 --> 00:04:24,974
We can't get our hopes up Mary. 

96
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:26,664
I keep trying to tell you this. 

97
00:04:26,664 --> 00:04:28,053
Let's just get to work. 

98
00:04:34,486 --> 00:04:37,106
An annulment is kind of a drastic measure. 

99
00:04:37,106 --> 00:04:38,325
I, I just thought... 

100
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:39,870
Where's my mother now? 

101
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,091
She's with her husband. 

102
00:04:41,091 --> 00:04:43,316
-Her husband? He's nothing but a...  -Claire

103
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,849
No I'll say my say. 

104
00:04:45,693 --> 00:04:47,707
You're no better then he is, 

105
00:04:47,707 --> 00:04:49,432
taking advantage of a... 

106
00:04:49,432 --> 00:04:52,270
I am not taking advantage of anyone ma'am. 

107
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,045
And I will thank you not to draw conclusions 

108
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,847
about who and what I am. 

109
00:04:56,847 --> 00:04:59,079
You're a lawyer. That's all I need to know. 

110
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,128
Claire, that's enough. 

111
00:05:01,929 --> 00:05:03,420
According to Mr. Turner, 

112
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,705
he loves your mother very much. 

113
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:05,144
Oh right. 

114
00:05:05,144 --> 00:05:08,096
She lacked the capacity to enter into a contract, 

115
00:05:08,096 --> 00:05:10,218
-marital or...   -How do you figure? Duress?

116
00:05:10,218 --> 00:05:11,040
What are the grounds? 

117
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,502
She has Alzheimer's Ms. Washington. 

118
00:05:15,488 --> 00:05:16,670
You didn't know this? 

119
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:21,305
Your client married a woman with Alzheimer's. 

120
00:05:23,077 --> 00:05:24,030
So? 

121
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:28,590
It's illegal for somebody with Alzheimer's to get married? 

122
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:32,084
Well it does raise some capacity issues. 

123
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:34,926
So what's gonna happen? 

124
00:05:34,926 --> 00:05:36,508
Well there's going to be a hearing. 

125
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:38,719
Mr. Turner you'll have to take the stand. 

126
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:40,696
I think they plan on calling a doctor, 

127
00:05:40,696 --> 00:05:42,661
and then Mrs. Turner, you'll have to testify. 

128
00:05:42,661 --> 00:05:45,047
No, I won't let her be put through that. 

129
00:05:45,473 --> 00:05:47,640
She has to demonstrate to the court 

130
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,708
that she was competent to get married. 

131
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:53,112
If Claire were concerned about her mother's well fair, 

132
00:05:53,112 --> 00:05:55,433
she wouldn't have stuck her in that home. 

133
00:05:55,862 --> 00:05:59,256
Now she's not gonna be put through testimony. 

134
00:05:59,256 --> 00:06:00,076
I'm afraid that she... 

135
00:06:00,076 --> 00:06:01,731
Ah...I said no. 

136
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:05,994
Mr. Turner, you hired me to help you. 

137
00:06:05,994 --> 00:06:08,612
If you plan to keep this marriage from being annulled, 

138
00:06:08,612 --> 00:06:10,816
your wife will have to testify. 

139
00:06:10,816 --> 00:06:13,768
I can do it sweetheart. 

140
00:06:13,768 --> 00:06:19,096
All I have to do is show them that I'm continent. 

141
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,566
That's competent. 

142
00:06:23,127 --> 00:06:24,948
Yes. 

143
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:28,566
We should get in. 

144
00:06:38,502 --> 00:06:39,813
Mr. Bresler, 

145
00:06:41,582 --> 00:06:43,109
I appreciate you taking the time.

146
00:06:43,109 --> 00:06:44,659
Yeah, um, like I said, 

147
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:45,829
I only got a couple minutes. 

148
00:06:50,206 --> 00:06:53,333
You're house is right across from the Kearns? 

149
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:53,731
Was. 

150
00:06:53,731 --> 00:06:57,028
I, uh, got divorced and moved about six years ago. 

151
00:06:57,028 --> 00:07:00,189
Well, in any case, going to that night, 

152
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:02,696
you can be sure it was Stuart Donovan 

153
00:07:02,696 --> 00:07:04,038
you saw go into that house? 

154
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:05,019
Positive. 

155
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:07,465
Can you tell me how you happened to see him? 

156
00:07:07,465 --> 00:07:12,175
I was watching Johnny Carson when I saw his camero pull up. 

157
00:07:12,175 --> 00:07:15,864
It was, uh, red with big tires and mag wheels. 

158
00:07:15,864 --> 00:07:18,345
It always makes a lot of noise, day and night. 

159
00:07:18,345 --> 00:07:20,839
So you actually saw Stuart get out of the car? 

160
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:21,590
Yes. 

161
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,980
Well he said he left around nine o'clock. 

162
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,975
Impossible. 

163
00:07:24,975 --> 00:07:27,416
It was between eleven-thirty and twelve. 

164
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,547
I told you, I was watching Carson. 

165
00:07:29,547 --> 00:07:32,325
Well, did you hear any screams come from the house? 

166
00:07:32,325 --> 00:07:32,979
No. 

167
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:37,976
You know he's gonna be executed in two weeks. 

168
00:07:38,973 --> 00:07:42,058
Yes. It's been on the news. 

169
00:07:42,058 --> 00:07:43,220
Well, given that, 

170
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,609
is there any chance it wasn't Stuart Donovan 

171
00:07:45,609 --> 00:07:46,826
you saw that night? 

172
00:07:48,012 --> 00:07:52,247
Mr. Young, I met the kid a few times back then. 

173
00:07:52,247 --> 00:07:54,845
He seemed like a real nice boy. 

174
00:07:54,845 --> 00:07:57,634
I'm not saying he did what they say he did, 

175
00:07:57,634 --> 00:08:00,676
but he did go in there that night. 

176
00:08:00,676 --> 00:08:02,687
There's no question about that. 

177
00:08:07,891 --> 00:08:10,353
Mr. Turner, how long have you known your wife? 

178
00:08:10,353 --> 00:08:12,378
Over thirty-five years. 

179
00:08:12,378 --> 00:08:16,481
I knew her late husband and they knew my first wife. 

180
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:19,214
I guess the question people are asking...

181
00:08:20,231 --> 00:08:22,169
she has Alzheimer's. 

182
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:25,709
I fell in love with her long before she was stricken with that. 

183
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,240
Certainly doesn't make me stop loving her. 

184
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,938
Okay, but it might stop you from being able to care for her. 

185
00:08:33,938 --> 00:08:35,610
If that day comes, 

186
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:39,194
I may have to consider putting her in a home. 

187
00:08:39,194 --> 00:08:42,303
But that day is not now Claire. 

188
00:08:42,303 --> 00:08:44,239
I'll tell you THAT! 

189
00:08:44,239 --> 00:08:45,862
You don't know what you're talking about Arthur. 

190
00:08:45,862 --> 00:08:47,101
-I would never...  -Ms. Stevens, 

191
00:08:47,101 --> 00:08:48,445
sit. 

192
00:08:49,713 --> 00:08:52,401
Mr. Turner, please do not address her. 

193
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:55,612
She's upset because I took her out of the home. 

194
00:08:55,612 --> 00:08:56,920
Yes she is. 

195
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,328
She thinks you married her to gain guardianship 

196
00:08:59,328 --> 00:09:01,083
so you could remove her from the home. 

197
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,665
I married her because I love her, 

198
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,280
and as a person who loves her, 

199
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,629
I wanted her out of that place. Damn right. 

200
00:09:10,687 --> 00:09:12,819
You snuck a minister into the nursing home 

201
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,910
where he performed the wedding service? 

202
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,139
Yes I did. 

203
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,380
And you have control of your wife's estate now, 

204
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,481
don't you Mr. Turner? 

205
00:09:19,481 --> 00:09:22,330
If Claire wanted her mother to be happy, 

206
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,117
she'd want her to be with me. 

207
00:09:24,117 --> 00:09:26,277
She wants her mother properly cared for. 

208
00:09:26,277 --> 00:09:27,908
And I'm doing that! 

209
00:09:27,908 --> 00:09:29,194
She has Alzheimer's, 

210
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,393
you're a seventy-six year old man with no training... 

211
00:09:31,393 --> 00:09:33,104
I can do better then they can. 

212
00:09:33,104 --> 00:09:34,084
That isn't true. 

213
00:09:34,084 --> 00:09:36,745
You're ill equipped to provide care... 

214
00:09:36,745 --> 00:09:38,311
I can take care of her! 

215
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,910
You, stop it! 

216
00:09:49,252 --> 00:09:52,716
Mrs. Turner, who is he? 

217
00:09:52,716 --> 00:09:54,721
What's his name? 

218
00:10:01,707 --> 00:10:03,390
She is not a witness here. 

219
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,385
No she isn't, but the court certainly would like to know 

220
00:10:06,385 --> 00:10:07,867
if she can answer the question. 

221
00:10:08,606 --> 00:10:11,905
Mrs. Turner, who is this man? 

222
00:10:13,628 --> 00:10:14,894
Do you know him? 

223
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:19,936
Of course I do. 

224
00:10:19,936 --> 00:10:21,507
Who is he? 

225
00:10:23,817 --> 00:10:25,468
His name...

226
00:10:25,468 --> 00:10:27,703
is Arthur Turner. 

227
00:10:27,703 --> 00:10:31,646
He is my lawfully wedded husband. 

228
00:10:31,646 --> 00:10:40,263
And I would appreciate it if all of you would leave the two of us alone. 

229
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:48,340
I've been having these dreams lately. 

230
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,606
What sort of dreams? 

231
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:52,212
That I'm asleep and I can't wake up. 

232
00:10:52,212 --> 00:10:56,070
Then I start thinking, they've already done it. 

233
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,026
I'm dead and this is what it feels like. 

234
00:11:01,376 --> 00:11:02,269
Yeah. 

235
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:07,784
I have a meeting with the informant in forty-five minutes. 

236
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:10,168
I really don't expect him to help me, 

237
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:13,095
unless he figures there's something we can give him. 

238
00:11:13,095 --> 00:11:16,432
Okay. Can you make 'em stop with the priest? 

239
00:11:16,432 --> 00:11:17,803
I'm sorry? 

240
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:19,845
This priest keeps coming to see me. 

241
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:23,190
He says it's important that I confess to god before I go. 

242
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,384
I'll deal with that. 

243
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,532
He says it's my only chance for absolution. 

244
00:11:26,532 --> 00:11:28,527
I will take care of the priest. 

245
00:11:28,527 --> 00:11:31,827
Stuart, don't talk to anybody. 

246
00:11:31,827 --> 00:11:33,567
Not even clergy. 

247
00:11:35,315 --> 00:11:37,337
Most of the time she's lucid, 

248
00:11:37,337 --> 00:11:41,098
but she does suffer bouts of both confusion and delusion. 

249
00:11:41,098 --> 00:11:44,212
And Doctor, does her condition stand to improve? 

250
00:11:44,212 --> 00:11:47,292
No. It's a progressive disease. 

251
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:50,468
Her cognitive abilities will eventually erode. 

252
00:11:50,468 --> 00:11:51,938
Probably completely. 

253
00:11:51,938 --> 00:11:53,934
What about care? 

254
00:11:53,934 --> 00:11:56,040
I think she's already at a point 

255
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,275
where she needs full-time supervision by a professional staff. 

256
00:11:59,275 --> 00:12:02,833
To entrust her to the care a seventy-six year old man with no training? 

257
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,742
That's a threat to her safety. 

258
00:12:05,704 --> 00:12:08,806
Does she seem to have deteriorated since she left the home? 

259
00:12:08,806 --> 00:12:10,154
It's only been a month. 

260
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:11,928
I'll ask the question again 

261
00:12:11,928 --> 00:12:16,114
Does she seem to have deteriorated since she left the home? 

262
00:12:16,114 --> 00:12:16,931
No. 

263
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:20,590
When you talk about the welfare or well being of a patient, 

264
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:24,054
whether she's happy or depressed, is that a factor? 

265
00:12:24,054 --> 00:12:25,033
Of course. 

266
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:29,026
And if Mrs. Turner were happier living with Mr. Turner, 

267
00:12:29,026 --> 00:12:32,850
that is something to consider medically as well, isn't it? 

268
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,141
It's not the only thing to consider. Given her age... 

269
00:12:35,141 --> 00:12:36,665
My question is, 

270
00:12:36,665 --> 00:12:39,838
Isn't it possible she would be better off living with him, 

271
00:12:39,838 --> 00:12:41,862
especially when he loves her? 

272
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:46,090
The likelihood of him being able to take care of her is so remote... 

273
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:50,274
But if you were satisfied that he could take care of her, 

274
00:12:50,274 --> 00:12:54,379
she's better off living with him than in a nursing home, isn't she? 

275
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:56,288
That's a very big 'if'. 

276
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,374
But probably, yes. 

277
00:12:59,374 --> 00:13:01,150
Thank you. 

278
00:13:12,664 --> 00:13:13,718
Mr. Kearns? 

279
00:13:13,718 --> 00:13:15,074
Yes? 

280
00:13:15,074 --> 00:13:17,071
My name is James Berluti, sir. 

281
00:13:17,071 --> 00:13:18,827
As I'm sure you know, 

282
00:13:18,827 --> 00:13:21,030
Stuart Donovan is soon to be executed 

283
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,860
for the murder of your wife and daughter. 

284
00:13:23,315 --> 00:13:24,476
And? 

285
00:13:24,476 --> 00:13:27,659
At the risk of you slamming the door on my face, 

286
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:30,287
I've been hired by Stuart's mother. 

287
00:13:30,287 --> 00:13:35,418
If I could, and I know how offensive this must seem, 

288
00:13:35,418 --> 00:13:39,479
I'd like to ask you just a couple of questions. 

289
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,869
I was working the graveyard shift, 

290
00:13:44,869 --> 00:13:46,781
but I remember before I left 

291
00:13:46,781 --> 00:13:49,523
my wife trying to calm Alissa down. 

292
00:13:49,523 --> 00:13:51,340
Do you know why? 

293
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,262
Alissa had broken up with Stuart a few days before, 

294
00:13:55,262 --> 00:13:58,084
and he was calling her and harassing her. 

295
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,266
She was pretty upset. 

296
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:05,727
I didn't take it seriously though. 

297
00:14:05,727 --> 00:14:10,467
And when I came home, and saw what he had done to her. 

298
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,910
This may be the part that sounds offensive, 

299
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:18,401
but can you think of anybody else 

300
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:22,354
who may have wanted to harm your daughter or your wife? 

301
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:28,334
Mr. Berluti, I understand as a parent, 

302
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:32,950
Mary Donovan will do anything to prevent her son's execution. 

303
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:36,858
But you tell her from me that, 

304
00:14:36,858 --> 00:14:42,258
as a parent, she should understand that I won't feel any peace 

305
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:46,770
until the person who raped and murdered my daughter is put to death. 

306
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,946
And you can tell her I'll see her soon 

307
00:14:48,946 --> 00:14:50,540
because I plan to be there. 

308
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:55,338
I plan to be there for his last breath, 

309
00:14:55,338 --> 00:14:58,514
just like he was for my wife and daughter's. 

310
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:02,732
I understand you want closure, sir, 

311
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:05,728
but if he didn't do it, 

312
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,193
when they execute him, that's it. 

313
00:15:09,193 --> 00:15:12,200
They got the real killer Mr. Berluti. 

314
00:15:18,409 --> 00:15:19,981
I don't want her testifying. 

315
00:15:19,981 --> 00:15:20,747
Mr. Turner... 

316
00:15:20,747 --> 00:15:22,982
It ain't hard to get her confused Rebecca. 

317
00:15:22,982 --> 00:15:24,305
You're just going to... 

318
00:15:24,305 --> 00:15:27,700
The Judge has made it clear he needs to hear from her. 

319
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,271
I'll try my best to protect her, but she has to testify. 

320
00:15:31,271 --> 00:15:34,169
Why don't you two stop your fussing? 

321
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:38,027
He's not gonna hurt me with everybody watching. 

322
00:15:38,027 --> 00:15:41,950
Frank's just a big coward when you come right down to it. 

323
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,357
Who's Frank?

324
00:15:43,357 --> 00:15:44,490
Her first husband. 

325
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:49,220
Frank's not gonna be there Gertie. 

326
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,291
Well then why are we all so worried? 

327
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,981
Claire's gonna be in there with her lawyer 

328
00:15:55,981 --> 00:15:58,857
saying you and I shouldn't be married. 

329
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,383
Married? 

330
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:08,782
Well I suspect Frank will have something to say about that. 

331
00:16:10,155 --> 00:16:11,667
Frank's dead. 

332
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,325
You remember that.

333
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,774
Oh yes. 

334
00:16:23,177 --> 00:16:24,794
Just as well.

335
00:16:42,971 --> 00:16:43,960
Who are you? 

336
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,877
I represent Stuart Donovan, 

337
00:16:45,877 --> 00:16:48,821
the man who's about to be executed on your testimony. 

338
00:16:48,821 --> 00:16:52,352
Don't be laying that on me. Other folks testified. 

339
00:16:52,352 --> 00:16:54,690
But your testimony was especially powerful. 

340
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,061
You said that he confessed to you. 

341
00:16:57,061 --> 00:16:57,739
He did. 

342
00:16:57,739 --> 00:17:00,604
Really? Why would he do that? 

343
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:03,240
Had an attack of conscience I guess. 

344
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,256
Seems to happen a lot around you, doesn't it? 

345
00:17:05,256 --> 00:17:10,485
Back in 1988, you were arrested for robbing a liquor store 

346
00:17:10,485 --> 00:17:12,888
and then you testified that Stuart Donovan confessed 

347
00:17:12,888 --> 00:17:14,774
and you got a reduced sentence. 

348
00:17:14,774 --> 00:17:18,762
Then arrested in '91 and '93 on other charges, 

349
00:17:18,762 --> 00:17:21,544
both times you became a snitch on jailhouse confessions 

350
00:17:21,544 --> 00:17:24,981
and both times you got a reduced sentence. 

351
00:17:24,981 --> 00:17:26,943
People open up to me. 

352
00:17:26,943 --> 00:17:30,556
Stuart Donovan is about to be executed. 

353
00:17:30,556 --> 00:17:33,335
Do you really want that on your conscience? 

354
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:36,186
You are a burglar and an armed robber, 

355
00:17:36,186 --> 00:17:39,626
but you have never killed anyone. 

356
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:42,809
Don't start with Stuart Donovan. 

357
00:17:46,913 --> 00:17:48,166
What do you want from me? 

358
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,785
A statement saying that you lied. 

359
00:17:50,785 --> 00:17:52,232
That he never confessed. 

360
00:17:52,232 --> 00:17:54,732
The statute of limitation is run on perjury, 

361
00:17:54,732 --> 00:17:56,609
you won't have to worry about that. 

362
00:18:05,805 --> 00:18:07,271
I'll do it...

363
00:18:09,612 --> 00:18:11,632
if you get me a bring-down to County. 

364
00:18:12,532 --> 00:18:14,183
Curran-Frumhold Facility. 

365
00:18:14,183 --> 00:18:16,090
I don't know how I can do that. 

366
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:21,889
Then we got nothing to talk about. 

367
00:18:21,889 --> 00:18:25,484
Earl, a man is about to die! 

368
00:18:25,484 --> 00:18:28,377
No bring-down, no statement. 

369
00:18:46,281 --> 00:18:49,172
The question we have Mrs. Turner, is

370
00:18:49,172 --> 00:18:52,142
whether you fully appreciated what you were doing 

371
00:18:52,142 --> 00:18:54,348
when you took this man for your husband. 

372
00:18:54,348 --> 00:18:57,871
The question you have is whether I'm nuts. 

373
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,893
I can fully appreciate that. 

374
00:19:00,893 --> 00:19:03,299
I need some strait answers ma'am. 

375
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:06,035
Why do I own anybody anything? 

376
00:19:06,035 --> 00:19:12,006
I didn't see anybody here coming to visit me in that home. 

377
00:19:12,006 --> 00:19:16,963
All you people care so much, 

378
00:19:16,963 --> 00:19:18,737
where were you?

379
00:19:18,737 --> 00:19:21,199
Where were you Claire? 

380
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:23,611
Please don't address your daughter ma'am. 

381
00:19:23,611 --> 00:19:27,295
Arthur is the only one who wants to take care of me. 

382
00:19:27,295 --> 00:19:31,399
He's the only one who loves me. Frank didn't. 

383
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:33,125
Who's Frank? 

384
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,349
He's dead, that's who he is. 

385
00:19:35,349 --> 00:19:37,073
Frank was her first husband. 

386
00:19:37,073 --> 00:19:39,335
Bang on the head, he's dead. 

387
00:19:41,241 --> 00:19:45,259
Arthur's idea to say he fell. 

388
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:48,100
Excuse me? 

389
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:52,091
You wouldn't stop him. 

390
00:19:55,507 --> 00:19:57,568
The man beat on me. 

391
00:19:57,568 --> 00:19:58,929
Gertie! 

392
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:01,994
Bang on the head, he's dead. 

393
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:03,046
Oh my god! 

394
00:20:03,046 --> 00:20:04,603
Your Honor, could we take a short recess? 

395
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:05,869
No, actually. 

396
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:09,387
Mrs. Turner, Frank, your first husband, 

397
00:20:09,387 --> 00:20:10,971
how did he die? 

398
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,320
He fell. 

399
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,204
He fell? 

400
00:20:15,204 --> 00:20:18,738
A second ago you were suggesting that Arthur hit him on the head. 

401
00:20:18,738 --> 00:20:20,511
That's what happened. 

402
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:24,875
He fell after Arthur hit him on the head.

403
00:20:27,037 --> 00:20:34,181
Arthur is the only one who loves me. 

404
00:20:34,181 --> 00:20:38,421
And he killed your first husband? 

405
00:20:38,421 --> 00:20:43,629
You can't force me to testify against him. 

406
00:20:44,874 --> 00:20:47,744
He's my husband now. 

407
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:51,094
I don't have to say a word. 

408
00:20:52,191 --> 00:20:53,316
Right honey? 

409
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:04,894
Well I hope you're happy. 

410
00:21:04,894 --> 00:21:05,542
What? 

411
00:21:05,542 --> 00:21:08,773
That double lujack, that annulment thing, 

412
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:11,698
turns out sweet Arthur's a murderer. 

413
00:21:11,698 --> 00:21:13,277
Excuse me? 

414
00:21:13,277 --> 00:21:15,628
Well it seems Arthur whacked her first husband 

415
00:21:15,628 --> 00:21:16,661
with a two-by-four, 

416
00:21:16,661 --> 00:21:18,116
and married her, maybe, 

417
00:21:18,116 --> 00:21:20,167
so that she could avail herself of spousal privilege 

418
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:21,672
and wouldn't have to testify. 

419
00:21:21,672 --> 00:21:22,524
What? 

420
00:21:22,524 --> 00:21:24,004
It doesn't all make sense. 

421
00:21:24,004 --> 00:21:25,551
The guy was killed fifteen years ago, 

422
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:26,749
why get married now? 

423
00:21:27,842 --> 00:21:29,969
Anyway, the judge annulled the marriage 

424
00:21:29,969 --> 00:21:32,232
and referred the matter to Helen Gamble. 

425
00:21:32,232 --> 00:21:33,905
You're helping me on this Bobby, 

426
00:21:33,905 --> 00:21:35,419
you lujacked me into a murder. 

427
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,705
I lujacked to Lindsay. 

428
00:21:36,705 --> 00:21:39,129
Fine, then you can both help me. 

429
00:21:43,022 --> 00:21:44,821
It was a terrible thing. 

430
00:21:44,821 --> 00:21:47,179
Did you see Stuart Donovan that night? 

431
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:50,742
No, I was in Florida visiting my folks that month. 

432
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:53,175
That month? You were away a whole month? 

433
00:21:53,175 --> 00:21:56,392
Mr. Young, my husband was a drunk back then. 

434
00:21:56,392 --> 00:21:58,091
There's no mystery here. 

435
00:21:58,091 --> 00:21:59,225
The reason we got divorced was 

436
00:21:59,225 --> 00:22:01,001
because I got tired of seeing him passed out 

437
00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:02,253
every night at nine o'clock. 

438
00:22:02,253 --> 00:22:05,947
He slept in that chair there for six strait years. 

439
00:22:05,947 --> 00:22:07,183
Nine o'clock? 

440
00:22:07,183 --> 00:22:10,299
He said he saw Stuart Donovan between eleven-thirty and twelve. 

441
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:11,562
Yeah, well. 

442
00:22:11,562 --> 00:22:13,151
Well what? 

443
00:22:13,151 --> 00:22:14,555
I wasn't here Mr. Young, 

444
00:22:14,555 --> 00:22:15,612
I was in Florida. 

445
00:22:15,612 --> 00:22:17,614
Mrs. Bresler, I'm not going after your ex husband. 

446
00:22:17,614 --> 00:22:20,221
I got a guy looking at death in two weeks 

447
00:22:20,221 --> 00:22:21,742
for a crime he didn't commit. 

448
00:22:21,742 --> 00:22:22,792
He confessed... 

449
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:23,850
No he didn't. 

450
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:29,266
Is it possible your ex husband was lying 

451
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:31,076
about that eleven-thirty business? 

452
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,874
I don't think he would lie. 

453
00:22:34,874 --> 00:22:38,564
But? There was a 'but' in your tone. 

454
00:22:38,564 --> 00:22:41,039
He could have believed it was eleven-thirty 

455
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,592
when it may have been nine. 

456
00:22:42,592 --> 00:22:46,388
By that time he would have been twelve sheets to the wind. 

457
00:22:47,227 --> 00:22:49,603
Why didn't you tell this to the police? 

458
00:22:49,603 --> 00:22:51,647
I did. 

459
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:55,722
Get this...

460
00:22:55,722 --> 00:22:58,902
Turns out Johnny Carson had a prime-time special on that night. 

461
00:22:58,902 --> 00:23:00,662
This guy might have thought it was eleven-thirty 

462
00:23:00,662 --> 00:23:01,854
when he saw Johnny Carson on 

463
00:23:01,854 --> 00:23:03,396
when it was really only nine. 

464
00:23:03,396 --> 00:23:05,541
So we have a bogus eyewitness 

465
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:07,412
on top of a bogus informant? 

466
00:23:07,412 --> 00:23:08,382
So what happens? 

467
00:23:08,382 --> 00:23:10,810
They have to order a new trial now, don't they? 

468
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:11,500
No way. 

469
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,047
How can they not? 

470
00:23:13,047 --> 00:23:15,707
Mary, I haven't solved the confession thing yet. 

471
00:23:15,707 --> 00:23:18,007
He only recants if I get him transferred to county jail, 

472
00:23:18,007 --> 00:23:21,225
and I haven't a clue as how to pull that off. 

473
00:23:21,225 --> 00:23:23,137
All we have to do is get him to court. 

474
00:23:23,898 --> 00:23:24,999
What do you mean? 

475
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:27,956
The Curran-Frumhold Facility is used as a lock-up 

476
00:23:27,956 --> 00:23:29,426
for the common-pleas court. 

477
00:23:29,426 --> 00:23:32,217
If he could get into court on anything, 

478
00:23:32,217 --> 00:23:33,569
that's where they'll hold him. 

479
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:38,934
It was referred to Helen? 

480
00:23:38,934 --> 00:23:40,671
And she wants to talk to them. 

481
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:41,444
Not a chance. 

482
00:23:41,444 --> 00:23:43,603
She implied she might file charges if they don't talk. 

483
00:23:43,603 --> 00:23:45,455
Let her. It was fifteen years ago. 

484
00:23:45,455 --> 00:23:46,943
She's gonna make murder on the testimony 

485
00:23:46,943 --> 00:23:48,478
of a witness with Alzheimer's? 

486
00:23:48,478 --> 00:23:50,309
For a fifteen year old crime? 

487
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:51,355
Good luck. 

488
00:23:51,355 --> 00:23:51,973
Well, even so, 

489
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:53,904
if we can spare them from being put through a trial. 

490
00:23:53,904 --> 00:23:55,524
This can't get prosecuted. 

491
00:23:55,524 --> 00:23:56,580
Don't be so sure. 

492
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,760
Helen, thanks for calling first. 

493
00:23:59,176 --> 00:24:01,028
You're not talking to them. 

494
00:24:01,028 --> 00:24:03,686
Bobby, we already have her recorded testimony. 

495
00:24:03,686 --> 00:24:05,867
Oh right, you'll be sure to get a guilty with that. 

496
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:08,655
Apparently the dead husband used to abuse her. 

497
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,587
Oh, and that means Arthur killed him? 

498
00:24:10,587 --> 00:24:12,127
Rebecca, she said he did. 

499
00:24:12,127 --> 00:24:13,425
Because she has Alzheimer's. 

500
00:24:13,425 --> 00:24:15,609
And because it's probably true. 

501
00:24:16,544 --> 00:24:17,915
Let me just talk to them. 

502
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:18,698
No way. 

503
00:24:18,698 --> 00:24:20,007
Then he'll probably get charged. 

504
00:24:20,007 --> 00:24:22,051
Well we're not letting you speak to them. 

505
00:24:22,983 --> 00:24:26,425
Please don't make me prosecute a seventy-six year old man. 

506
00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:28,591
You're not talking to them. 

507
00:24:35,087 --> 00:24:36,572
He's in the conference room. 

508
00:24:36,572 --> 00:24:38,294
You got to be kidding. 

509
00:24:38,294 --> 00:24:40,088
If I can't ask her questions here, 

510
00:24:40,088 --> 00:24:42,199
I will just do it at a PC hearing. 

511
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:44,428
Bobby? 

512
00:24:44,428 --> 00:24:45,187
No. 

513
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:48,222
Okay, let's go. 

514
00:24:53,712 --> 00:24:54,883
What's going on? 

515
00:24:54,883 --> 00:24:57,030
Don't say anything Arthur, they're arresting you. 

516
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,041
We'll take care of it. 

517
00:24:58,041 --> 00:24:59,313
Arresting me? 

518
00:24:59,313 --> 00:25:00,975
I'm gonna go to the precinct with you. 

519
00:25:00,975 --> 00:25:02,751
Lindsay and Bobby, they'll look after Gertrude. 

520
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,609
Where are they taking him? 

521
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:07,036
I'm all right Gertie. Don't you worry. 

522
00:25:07,805 --> 00:25:09,359
You have the right to remain silent. 

523
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:11,651
Anything you say can and will be used against you 

524
00:25:11,651 --> 00:25:12,515
in a court of law. 

525
00:25:12,515 --> 00:25:13,771
You have the right to an attorney 

526
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:22,584
What do you mean new lawyer? 

527
00:25:22,584 --> 00:25:24,103
A private defense attorney. 

528
00:25:24,103 --> 00:25:25,550
What are you talking about? 

529
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,407
I'm trying to get you to county, 

530
00:25:27,407 --> 00:25:28,789
and this is how it works

531
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:30,555
Your new private attorney will go in 

532
00:25:30,555 --> 00:25:32,953
asking the state to pay your legal fees. 

533
00:25:32,953 --> 00:25:34,901
The court's gonna want to know what's wrong with your PD

534
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:36,293
and to get the answer, 

535
00:25:36,293 --> 00:25:37,837
they're gonna need to hear from you. 

536
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:40,799
And for that, you've got to be there. 

537
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,980
You'll be transported to the Curran-Frumhold Facility 

538
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,219
to be available for your evidentiary presentation, 

539
00:25:46,219 --> 00:25:47,654
and then after the hearing 

540
00:25:47,654 --> 00:25:48,894
you'll be brought back here. 

541
00:25:48,894 --> 00:25:51,271
This only happens if you give me the statement. 

542
00:25:51,271 --> 00:25:52,148
I will. 

543
00:25:52,148 --> 00:25:53,175
Well I need it now. 

544
00:25:53,175 --> 00:25:54,559
Well you don't get it now. 

545
00:25:55,425 --> 00:25:57,145
Not till after I go to Curran. 

546
00:25:57,145 --> 00:25:59,148
This could take some time, Stuart Donovan... 

547
00:25:59,148 --> 00:25:59,898
Well you know what? 

548
00:25:59,898 --> 00:26:01,281
I suggest you speed it up 

549
00:26:01,281 --> 00:26:02,708
cause I ain't giving you the statement 

550
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:04,111
until after I go to Curren.  

551
00:26:07,116 --> 00:26:08,158
That's bad. 

552
00:26:08,158 --> 00:26:10,924
The soonest we can get Earl to Curran is ten days. 

553
00:26:10,924 --> 00:26:12,691
If we wait that long and strike out 

554
00:26:12,691 --> 00:26:14,166
that leaves us with just four days. 

555
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:15,571
We can't risk that. 

556
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,193
Let's still go in tomorrow. 

557
00:26:19,193 --> 00:26:20,211
With what? 

558
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:23,422
Well, we got the ex wife's affidavit on the witnesses drinking. 

559
00:26:23,422 --> 00:26:26,264
We got possible prosecutorial misconduct there as well. 

560
00:26:26,264 --> 00:26:29,017
You can also represent, as an officer of the court, 

561
00:26:29,017 --> 00:26:31,099
that Taylor's prepared to recant on the confession. 

562
00:26:31,099 --> 00:26:32,310
I mean that's got to be enough 

563
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,408
to at least get an order for a DNA test. 

564
00:26:34,408 --> 00:26:36,880
I, I would like to go in with more then that. 

565
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,063
Look, you feel guaranteed you'll get that statement from Taylor? 

566
00:26:41,063 --> 00:26:42,205
Guaranteed, from that guy? 

567
00:26:42,205 --> 00:26:42,783
Hardly. 

568
00:26:42,783 --> 00:26:45,594
Then we can't waste ten days banking on him. 

569
00:26:45,594 --> 00:26:48,149
Lets go in with what we got. 

570
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:03,366
Okay, lets do it. 

571
00:27:06,308 --> 00:27:08,221
I don't know about conviction, 

572
00:27:08,221 --> 00:27:10,347
but beating probable cause? 

573
00:27:10,347 --> 00:27:11,960
That's a very low threshold. 

574
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,926
She got confused about things. 

575
00:27:14,926 --> 00:27:17,564
Well, what was she confused about? 

576
00:27:17,564 --> 00:27:19,466
She said you hit him on the head. 

577
00:27:19,466 --> 00:27:21,206
Did that come out of nowhere? 

578
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:24,256
Yes. The man fell. 

579
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,759
They'll probably call her to the stand. 

580
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:28,348
No. 

581
00:27:28,348 --> 00:27:30,798
This is a criminal proceeding, I can't... 

582
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:32,651
I don't want her put in the witness chair again. 

583
00:27:35,663 --> 00:27:37,269
We need to protect her. 

584
00:27:37,982 --> 00:27:40,767
Are you looking to protect her or yourself? 

585
00:27:40,767 --> 00:27:43,640
You think I'm a murderer now, Ms. Washington? 

586
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,655
I don't really know you Mr. Turner. 

587
00:27:45,655 --> 00:27:48,048
You don't strike me as being anything but gentle. 

588
00:27:48,048 --> 00:27:50,150
But as your lawyer, let me tell you, 

589
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,139
they already have her recorded testimony 

590
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:53,620
from the annulment proceeding. 

591
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:57,122
They could probably satisfy probable cause with that. 

592
00:27:57,122 --> 00:27:59,223
But they couldn't convict on it, right? 

593
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,093
If you're to avoid a trial, 

594
00:28:05,658 --> 00:28:09,355
the best thing is for Gertrude to testify at probable cause 

595
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:12,097
and say you didn't do what she said you did, 

596
00:28:12,097 --> 00:28:13,787
that she was confused. 

597
00:28:13,787 --> 00:28:15,908
I don't want her to testify. 

598
00:28:17,968 --> 00:28:20,176
I don't think you have a choice. 

599
00:28:25,364 --> 00:28:26,367
May I please the court, 

600
00:28:26,367 --> 00:28:27,663
my name is Ellenor Frutt 

601
00:28:27,663 --> 00:28:30,859
and I am joined by my colleagues Eugene Young and James Berluti. 

602
00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:33,118
We are here representing Stuart Donovan 

603
00:28:33,118 --> 00:28:36,123
and his petition to get a court ordered DNA test, 

604
00:28:36,123 --> 00:28:39,204
which test would likely exonerate him of the crime 

605
00:28:39,204 --> 00:28:40,725
of which he has been convicted, 

606
00:28:40,725 --> 00:28:43,041
which conviction has him scheduled for death 

607
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:46,082
by lethal injection in fourteen days. 

608
00:28:46,082 --> 00:28:47,780
In order for us to prevail, 

609
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,491
we must show by clear and convincing evidence 

610
00:28:50,491 --> 00:28:51,942
that it would be unreasonable 

611
00:28:51,942 --> 00:28:54,325
for a jury to have found my client guilty 

612
00:28:54,325 --> 00:28:55,379
under the evidence. 

613
00:28:55,379 --> 00:28:56,353
Before we get to that, 

614
00:28:56,353 --> 00:28:57,564
you must also show that 

615
00:28:57,564 --> 00:29:00,609
your client's constitutional rights were violated. 

616
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:02,375
I believe we can make that showing, your honor. 

617
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:04,313
One of the key eyewitnesses on the case 

618
00:29:04,313 --> 00:29:06,687
suffered from a very serious drinking problem. 

619
00:29:06,687 --> 00:29:08,346
That's exculpatory evidence 

620
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:10,641
the state failed to turn over to the defense. 

621
00:29:10,641 --> 00:29:12,879
This drinking problem was relevant? 

622
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:14,162
We believe it was your honor, 

623
00:29:14,162 --> 00:29:16,552
since the events he claimed to have witnessed 

624
00:29:16,552 --> 00:29:17,895
occurred at a time of night 

625
00:29:17,895 --> 00:29:19,662
when his capacity for observation 

626
00:29:19,662 --> 00:29:22,142
was routinely undermined by his inebriated... 

627
00:29:22,142 --> 00:29:23,945
He was drunk on the night in question? 

628
00:29:23,945 --> 00:29:25,463
According to his ex wife, 

629
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:28,793
whose affidavit is attached to our memorandum as exhibit D, 

630
00:29:28,793 --> 00:29:32,469
she said her husband was habitually drunk every night... 

631
00:29:32,469 --> 00:29:36,310
Can she verify that he was intoxicated on this night? 

632
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,963
She wasn't there, but she's basing... 

633
00:29:37,963 --> 00:29:38,724
Thank you. 

634
00:29:38,724 --> 00:29:41,732
You can verify that the prosecution knew of his drinking problem? 

635
00:29:41,732 --> 00:29:43,895
Yes. Mrs. Bresler told the police 

636
00:29:43,895 --> 00:29:45,835
that her husband was typically passed out 

637
00:29:45,835 --> 00:29:47,247
by nine o'clock every night 

638
00:29:47,247 --> 00:29:49,938
and that he was quite possibly confused 

639
00:29:49,938 --> 00:29:53,229
as to the time he said he saw my client's car pull up. 

640
00:29:53,229 --> 00:29:56,773
This was never brought to the attention of the defense, 

641
00:29:56,773 --> 00:30:00,324
and accordingly, Mr. Bresler was never cross-examined on it. 

642
00:30:00,324 --> 00:30:03,147
Wasn't the defense free to discover all this? 

643
00:30:03,147 --> 00:30:05,337
The fact that the defense was free to discover it 

644
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:07,490
does not absolve the state's obligation 

645
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:09,842
to turn over all exculpatory evidence. 

646
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:11,315
Here they didn't. 

647
00:30:11,315 --> 00:30:12,354
All right counsel, 

648
00:30:12,354 --> 00:30:14,594
but we also have a confession in this case... 

649
00:30:14,594 --> 00:30:16,533
That confession was tainted, your honor. 

650
00:30:16,533 --> 00:30:18,542
I spoke to Earl Taylor, 

651
00:30:18,542 --> 00:30:20,887
the jailhouse informant who secured that confession, 

652
00:30:20,887 --> 00:30:24,174
and he indicated to me that that statement was false. 

653
00:30:24,174 --> 00:30:26,574
He also conveyed his willingness to recant it, 

654
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:29,522
as you can see from my affidavit, exhibit F. 

655
00:30:29,522 --> 00:30:32,555
That means we have a false confession 

656
00:30:32,555 --> 00:30:36,319
backed up by very questionable eyewitness testimony, 

657
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:38,684
and these two pieces of evidence 

658
00:30:38,684 --> 00:30:42,259
represent the prosecution's case in it's entirety. 

659
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:44,912
A lie from a jailhouse snitch, 

660
00:30:44,912 --> 00:30:48,099
and the observations of an intoxicated alcoholic. 

661
00:30:48,099 --> 00:30:49,579
That's it. 

662
00:30:49,579 --> 00:30:51,575
Plus a blood match. 

663
00:30:51,575 --> 00:30:52,636
Well do we? 

664
00:30:52,636 --> 00:30:53,840
That's why we're here, 

665
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,513
to seek confirmation of the blood match. 

666
00:30:56,513 --> 00:30:59,834
There was no DNA technology twelve years ago, 

667
00:30:59,834 --> 00:31:03,592
but we now have the ability to run a dispositive test, 

668
00:31:03,592 --> 00:31:05,523
and that's what we're asking for. 

669
00:31:05,523 --> 00:31:09,008
Stuart Donovan is scheduled for death. 

670
00:31:09,008 --> 00:31:10,859
We're asking for a test 

671
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:12,766
that would take only hours to see 

672
00:31:12,766 --> 00:31:15,773
if we are about to execute the right man. 

673
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:18,600
We're not petitioning that you set him free. 

674
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,116
We are not asking for a new trial. 

675
00:31:21,116 --> 00:31:25,458
Just one little test. 

676
00:31:29,698 --> 00:31:31,823
You said yesterday that Arthur 

677
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:34,145
had hit your late husband over the head. 

678
00:31:34,145 --> 00:31:35,892
At least that's what you implied. 

679
00:31:36,663 --> 00:31:38,037
Is that what happened? 

680
00:31:38,037 --> 00:31:40,815
I take the fifth commandment. 

681
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:44,034
You can't take a commandment in here ma'am. 

682
00:31:44,034 --> 00:31:46,411
My client has asserted her Fifth Amendment rights. 

683
00:31:46,411 --> 00:31:47,880
She's not being charged with anything. 

684
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,532
Doesn't matter, 

685
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:50,575
she's allowed to assert her Fifth Amendment rights 

686
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,764
when there's the prospect of criminal charges. 

687
00:31:52,764 --> 00:31:54,473
The commonwealth has no intention of... 

688
00:31:54,473 --> 00:31:55,822
She was there the time of the accident, 

689
00:31:55,822 --> 00:31:57,053
possible accessory charges. 

690
00:31:57,053 --> 00:31:59,480
Your honor, I'd ask the court to grant the witness immunity. 

691
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,899
She doesn't want immunity. 

692
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:02,832
Your honor, this is hard enough. 

693
00:32:02,832 --> 00:32:06,292
I agree. Councils, take your seats. 

694
00:32:07,438 --> 00:32:08,458
Mrs. Turner, 

695
00:32:08,458 --> 00:32:11,768
I'm granting you full immunity against prosecution. 

696
00:32:11,768 --> 00:32:14,975
Which means you won't be arrested for anything you say here. 

697
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:17,783
I want you to answer Ms. Gamble's questions. 

698
00:32:17,783 --> 00:32:18,936
Don't do it Gertie. 

699
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:20,188
Mr. Turner. 

700
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:24,708
He's my husband, I don't have to testify. 

701
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:26,914
No, your marriage was annulled. 

702
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:38,175
All right, council and the witness in chambers, please. 

703
00:32:38,175 --> 00:32:40,512
Mrs. Stevens, you too. 

704
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:45,544
Whether or not a witness had a drinking problem 

705
00:32:45,544 --> 00:32:46,882
is a collateral issue, 

706
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:48,130
certainly not one which would fall... 

707
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:50,111
Why didn't you tell the defense about it? 

708
00:32:50,111 --> 00:32:52,008
I'm not sure we didn't, 

709
00:32:52,008 --> 00:32:54,004
but assuming we didn't, 

710
00:32:54,004 --> 00:32:55,726
that goes to impeachment only. 

711
00:32:55,726 --> 00:32:57,301
That wasn't evidence. 

712
00:32:57,301 --> 00:33:00,108
More over, knowing of Mr. Bresler's problem, 

713
00:33:00,108 --> 00:33:03,444
a reasonable jury still could have chosen to believe him. 

714
00:33:03,444 --> 00:33:05,049
What about the confession? 

715
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:07,065
The state still stands by the confession. 

716
00:33:07,065 --> 00:33:10,192
Defense is now trying to bribe the informant 

717
00:33:10,192 --> 00:33:11,619
into recanting the statement he gave. 

718
00:33:11,619 --> 00:33:12,712
I object to that. 

719
00:33:12,712 --> 00:33:14,095
May it please the court, 

720
00:33:14,095 --> 00:33:16,991
Mr. Taylor contacted our office 

721
00:33:16,991 --> 00:33:19,586
and informed us of Ms. Frutt's attempts. 

722
00:33:19,586 --> 00:33:22,134
We outfitted him with a wire. 

723
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:26,283
She promised to try to get him transferred to a county facility 

724
00:33:26,283 --> 00:33:28,489
in exchange for him recanting the statement 

725
00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:30,600
concerning Mr. Donovan's confession. 

726
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,099
If you please.  

727
00:33:32,226 --> 00:33:34,255
This is how it works 

728
00:33:34,255 --> 00:33:35,966
Your new private attorney will go in 

729
00:33:35,966 --> 00:33:38,283
asking the state to pay your legal fees. 

730
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:39,260
The court's gonna want to know 

731
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,456
what's wrong with your PD 

732
00:33:40,456 --> 00:33:41,667
and to get the answer, 

733
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:43,298
they're gonna need to hear from you. 

734
00:33:43,298 --> 00:33:45,538
And for that, you've got to be there. 

735
00:33:45,538 --> 00:33:48,433
You'll be transported to the Curran-Frumhold Facility 

736
00:33:48,433 --> 00:33:50,741
to be available for your evidentiary presentation, 

737
00:33:50,741 --> 00:33:51,950
and then after the hearing 

738
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,288
you'll be brought back here.

739
00:33:53,935 --> 00:33:55,742
May I respond to that, your honor? 

740
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,394
I would hope you would. 

741
00:34:03,452 --> 00:34:06,019
Yes, I offered to help the informant 

742
00:34:06,019 --> 00:34:09,447
in exchange for him telling the truth. 

743
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:12,525
Just as the prosecution was free to play ball with him, 

744
00:34:12,525 --> 00:34:14,330
offering him a reduced prison term 

745
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:15,893
in exchange for his testimony, 

746
00:34:15,893 --> 00:34:18,218
so too am I free to make a deal. 

747
00:34:18,218 --> 00:34:20,120
I was not suborning perjury. 

748
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,515
Are you suggesting I was? 

749
00:34:21,515 --> 00:34:24,550
All I am suggesting is that Mr. Taylor is a liar... 

750
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,194
And better that he lie for you? 

751
00:34:26,194 --> 00:34:29,302
This informant is a professional witness. 

752
00:34:29,302 --> 00:34:32,006
He has gotten three of his own sentences cut down 

753
00:34:32,006 --> 00:34:33,782
by getting three different confessions. 

754
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:34,876
Who's kidding who here? 

755
00:34:34,876 --> 00:34:36,191
All right. 

756
00:34:38,996 --> 00:34:43,425
I would remind the court we are not asking you to stay an execution. 

757
00:34:43,425 --> 00:34:47,041
We are not asking for a mistrial, or a new trial. 

758
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:51,153
We are not begging you to commute a sentence or to show leniency. 

759
00:34:51,153 --> 00:34:56,357
Just a test, one that will tell us the truth. 

760
00:34:56,357 --> 00:34:59,116
And given the incredibly sketchy evidence 

761
00:34:59,116 --> 00:35:01,153
that's the basis of his conviction, 

762
00:35:01,153 --> 00:35:05,809
how can any system, that purports to offer even an appearance 

763
00:35:05,809 --> 00:35:08,852
of being about the truth, not say yes. 

764
00:35:08,852 --> 00:35:12,517
The state lost the rape kit. 

765
00:35:12,517 --> 00:35:13,719
They lost it. 

766
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:16,018
They didn't even bother to look for it. 

767
00:35:16,018 --> 00:35:18,439
We hunted for it, we dug it out, 

768
00:35:18,439 --> 00:35:19,237
we found it, 

769
00:35:19,237 --> 00:35:22,366
and now all we're asking is that you test it. 

770
00:35:22,366 --> 00:35:23,549
That isn't much. 

771
00:35:23,549 --> 00:35:28,165
It's certainly a lot less work then executing a man. 

772
00:35:38,317 --> 00:35:41,159
I know you love Arthur, but ma'am, 

773
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:44,416
I'm sure you loved your late husband too, didn't you? 

774
00:35:44,416 --> 00:35:46,266
Oh god no. 

775
00:35:47,494 --> 00:35:49,309
He hit me, Frank did. 

776
00:35:50,162 --> 00:35:52,830
Glad he died, truth be told. 

777
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:56,531
Okay. Did Arthur kill him? 

778
00:35:57,209 --> 00:36:00,289
Can you take us back to that day? 

779
00:36:03,498 --> 00:36:05,843
I don't want to go back to that day. 

780
00:36:05,843 --> 00:36:07,833
We need you to. 

781
00:36:12,432 --> 00:36:17,422
Frank was at me like everyday. 

782
00:36:17,422 --> 00:36:19,850
Yelling this and that. 

783
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,911
I told him before, 

784
00:36:24,652 --> 00:36:27,493
"you take your hand to me again"

785
00:36:28,682 --> 00:36:30,207
and he did.

786
00:36:30,207 --> 00:36:35,945
Right across the face like so many times before. 

787
00:36:37,184 --> 00:36:43,167
And I...saw it there. 

788
00:36:44,383 --> 00:36:46,031
You saw what? 

789
00:36:46,031 --> 00:36:51,164
The board. Laying on the counter. 

790
00:36:52,518 --> 00:36:55,954
I just...picked it up. 

791
00:36:55,954 --> 00:36:58,298
You picked it up? 

792
00:36:58,298 --> 00:37:02,856
Yeah I did. I told him, 

793
00:37:02,856 --> 00:37:06,954
"you take your hand to me"

794
00:37:11,768 --> 00:37:18,241
I didn't mean to kill him, just swat him down. 

795
00:37:19,415 --> 00:37:21,269
You hit your husband? 

796
00:37:22,163 --> 00:37:27,649
And Arthur came in and said "we'll just say he fell" 

797
00:37:28,464 --> 00:37:29,605
Mom... 

798
00:37:35,206 --> 00:37:38,817
I'm sorry Claire. 

799
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:42,323
I killed your daddy.

800
00:37:46,734 --> 00:37:51,646
What, why did you say Arthur did it? 

801
00:37:52,607 --> 00:37:59,024
Sometimes I think he did. 

802
00:38:01,453 --> 00:38:03,618
I get confused. 

803
00:38:07,274 --> 00:38:09,093
I think 

804
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,881
"how could I have..."

805
00:38:26,361 --> 00:38:28,112
I did...

806
00:38:51,298 --> 00:38:53,084
She says she killed him. 

807
00:38:57,278 --> 00:38:58,175
Did she? 

808
00:39:08,537 --> 00:39:10,086
I don't understand. 

809
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,717
She started talking about it. 

810
00:39:20,082 --> 00:39:24,225
I had to get her out of that home before she got herself into trouble. 

811
00:39:26,356 --> 00:39:28,603
So that's why you married her, 

812
00:39:28,603 --> 00:39:31,040
to get her out before she said too much? 

813
00:39:33,399 --> 00:39:35,041
That and I love her. 

814
00:39:37,711 --> 00:39:39,392
What are they gonna do to her? 

815
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:41,399
Nothing. 

816
00:39:41,399 --> 00:39:44,140
She's got immunity, remember? 

817
00:39:45,032 --> 00:39:46,695
So what happens? 

818
00:39:46,695 --> 00:39:48,201
You're free to go. 

819
00:39:48,201 --> 00:39:49,911
You can take her home if you want. 

820
00:39:54,906 --> 00:39:55,946
Where is she? 

821
00:40:01,084 --> 00:40:02,075
Gertie. 

822
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:12,319
They got me to tell. 

823
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,229
I'm gonna take you home sweetheart. 

824
00:40:15,855 --> 00:40:18,003
You're not mad at me? 

825
00:40:18,003 --> 00:40:19,901
Hey, I love you. 

826
00:40:34,363 --> 00:40:35,547
Be seated. 

827
00:40:38,591 --> 00:40:40,171
It is the opinion of this court 

828
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:44,232
that Stuart Donovan's constitutional rights were violated 

829
00:40:44,232 --> 00:40:47,658
by the District Attorney's failure to provide defense council 

830
00:40:47,658 --> 00:40:51,553
with the information concerning Mr. Bresler's drinking problems. 

831
00:40:51,553 --> 00:40:54,586
Certainly, armed with this information, 

832
00:40:54,586 --> 00:40:57,080
a jury might have been more inclined to

833
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,663
disbelieve this material witness. 

834
00:40:59,663 --> 00:41:05,803
As for the informant's statement concerning Mr. Donovan's confession, 

835
00:41:05,803 --> 00:41:09,388
that too is certainly in doubt. 

836
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,269
The standard for this court, however, 

837
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:17,697
is whether a reasonable jury could have found the defendant guilty. 

838
00:41:17,697 --> 00:41:20,547
While we feel the jury in this case, 

839
00:41:20,547 --> 00:41:22,937
given all this new information, 

840
00:41:22,937 --> 00:41:27,265
quite likely would have returned with a verdict of not guilty,

841
00:41:27,265 --> 00:41:30,883
we're not persuaded that they could not have reasonably 

842
00:41:30,883 --> 00:41:34,605
returned with a guilty just the same. 

843
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:40,367
The petitioner's request for a DNA test is therefore denied. 

844
00:41:40,367 --> 00:41:42,296
We are adjourned.
