我给你自愿的。

我不能。

Ellenor，我给你一个有预谋的谋杀误杀。 
Ellenor, I'm giving you manslaughter for a premeditated murder. 

15 
00:00:28,942 - > 00:00:31,440 
为什么你不能永远拿礼物和微笑吗？ 
Why can't you ever take a gift and smile? 

16

这是一个很好的协议，莎莉。 
It is a good deal, Sally. 

17

他们唯一可能的防御，我们是短暂的发疯。 
They only possible defense we have is temporary insanity. 

18 
00:00:45,967 - > 00:00:48,273 
因为你不想说，你是疯了...... 
And because you don't want to say that you were insane...

19 
00:00:48,273 - > 00:00:49,598 
我没有。 
I wasn't. 

20 
00:00:51,443 - > 00:00:55,149 
好吧，那我认为我们应该跳误杀。 
Well, then I think that we should jump at manslaughter. 

21 
00:00:57,963 - > 00:01:00,256 
您可能会被判处有期徒刑八年。

如果运气好的话，你只能为三个或四个。 
And with any luck, you'd only have to serve three or four.

莎莉，你枪杀一名手无寸铁的男子。 
Sally, you shot an unarmed man.

24 
00:01:09,188 - > 00:01:11,424 
如果有人被强奸并谋杀了我的女儿， 
If somebody raped and murdered my daughter, 

25 
00:01:11,424 - > 00:01:13,397 
我可能会做同样的事情。 
I might have done the same thing. 

26 
00:01:13,397 - > 00:01:16,563 
但问题是你刨。 
But the problem is you planed it. 

27 
00:01:16,563 - > 00:01:19,691 
如果我们去一个不认罪的元素， 
If we go for a not guilty on the elements, 

28 
00:01:20,673 - > 00:01:23,309 
你可以去监狱生活。

她不希望任期三年...

她想尝试击败它。

44 
00:02:56,229 - > 00:02:57,200 
是的，我们做到了。 
Yes, we did.

45 
00:02:57,200 - > 00:02:58,782 
那么，什么是你争论吗？疯狂？ 
So, what are you arguing? Insanity? 

46 
00:02:58,782 - > 00:03:01,070 
不，不幸的是，她并不想这样做，要么。 
No, unfortunately, she doesn't want to do that either. 

47 
00:03:01,070 - > 00:03:02,217 
谁是这里的负责人吗？

她是，她是客户端，还记得吗？

你是她的律师，这意味着你需要让她明白......

00:03:05,931 - > 00:03:07,314 
鲍比，不训斥我。

Judge Hiller is sitting, she won't let you argue nullification,

你知道她不会。

我得到医生锡伯杜的立场。

我们将发挥白痴，不是她的。 
We'll be played for the idiots, not her. 

59 
00:03:25,111 - > 00:03:26,846 
哦，所以，这是我们的自我？

我们试过了。 
We tried.

请再试一次。 
Try again. 

64 
00:03:35,286 - > 00:03:38,408 
如果她拒绝，提交一份议案，退出的法律顾问。 
If she refuses, file a motion to withdraw as counsel. 

65 
00:03:38,408 - > 00:03:41,183 
鲍比，这就像我们的拉比的情况下， 
Bobby, this is just like our rabbi case,

66 
00:03:41,183 - > 00:03:43,323 
也许我们可以再次争论道德胁迫。 
maybe we could argue moral duress again. 

67 
00:03:43,323 - > 00:03:46,028 
不，吉米，因为这个时候，我们必须判断希勒。 
No, Jimmy, because this time, we have judge Hiller. 

68 
00:03:46,681 - > 00:03:47,999 
返回到客户端， 
Go back to the client, 

69 
00:03:47,999 - > 00:03:50,203 
她要么需要，恳求疯狂manslaugher

或者我们退出。 
or we withdraw. 

71 
00:04:01,554 - > 00:04:02,750 
嘿，萨莉。 
Hey, Sally. 

72 
00:04:08,450 - > 00:04:09,897 
好吧，听着， 
All right, listen, 

73 
00:04:09,897 - > 00:04:11,843 
就像你反对prinple 
As much as you oppose it on prinple, 

74 
00:04:11,843 - > 00:04:14,204 
我们都同意，如果我们要去去试， 
we all agreed that if we're gonna go to trial, 

75 
00:04:14,204 - > 00:04:17,022 
我们必须去暂时的精神错乱。 
we have to go with temporary insanity. 

76 
00:04:17,022 - > 00:04:20,398 
我们唯一的其他选择 
The only other choice we have 

77 
00:04:20,398 - > 00:04:22,010 
是陪审团注销。 
is jury nullification. 

78 
00:04:22,010 - > 00:04:24,695 
法官将关闭我们在第二。 
And that judge will shut us down in a second. 

79 
00:04:24,695 - > 00:04:29,087 
但是，如果我们赢了就暂时，你可以避开监狱共有。 
But if we win on temporary, you could avoid prison altogether. 

80 
00:04:29,087 - > 00:04:33,091 
你有机会，但你必须让我们做我们的工作。 
You have a chance, but you have to let us do our job. 

81 
00:04:33,091 - > 00:04:35,057 
如果我们给你最好的代表... 
If we're to give you the best representation...

82 
00:04:36,283 - > 00:04:37,524 
她说了什么？ 
What did she say? 

83 
00:04:37,524 - > 00:04:38,729 
她只是叫我狗娘养的。 
She just called me a bitch. 

84 
00:04:38,729 - > 00:04:39,819 
瞧， 
Look, 

85 
00:04:39,819 - > 00:04:41,767 
我不需要你，我不需要这种情况下。 
I don't need you, and I don't need this case.

要我欠你什么？ 
To what do I owe this? 

94 
00:06:17,299 - > 00:06:20,215 
嗯，嗯，其实， 
Ah, well, actually, 

95 
00:06:20,215 - > 00:06:22,929 
我只是分配第二把椅子。

96 
00:06:22,929 - > 00:06:24,171 
请原谅我吗？ 
Excuse me?

它获得了大量的热量，所以... 
It's getting a lot of heat, so...

98 
00:06:26,030 - > 00:06:28,407 
他们把你就到了，什么，挡我？ 
They put you on to, what, backstop me? 

99 
00:06:29,315 - > 00:06:31,337 
我问要穿上它。 
I asked to be put on it. 

100 
00:06:31,337 - > 00:06:32,395 
为什么呢？ 
Why? 

101 
00:06:32,959 - > 00:06:35,370 
好吧， 
Well, 

102 
00:06:35,613 - > 00:06:39,011 
海伦，这是怎么回事呢？ 
Helen, what's going on?

00:06:39,011 - > 00:06:41,571 
这是怎么回事是... 
What's going on is...

104 
00:06:41,571 - > 00:06:43,810 
你少许回顾。 
you're a little under review.

105 
00:06:43,810 - > 00:06:45,635 
你是什​​么意思，我回顾？

106 
00:06:45,635 - > 00:06:49,674 
你下降了一些大的试验，除了失去这些情况， 
You've dropped some big trials and in addition to losing these cases, 

107 
00:06:49,674 - > 00:06:51,849

你不想要这个越来越远离你，相信我。 
You don't want this one getting away from you, trust me. 

112

所以，你......你问被提上 
So you...you asked to be put on

113 
00:07:07,879 - > 00:07:09,860 
因为我可能会失去我的工作吗？

你已经有一些相当高的配置文件失败，

你已经有点松佳能。

122 
00:07:33,313 - > 00:07:37,483 
理查德，让我们赢得这场。

我没有邀请他们。

127 
00:07:54,146 - > 00:07:56,231 
文具店的白痴犯了一个错误。

然后，她突然提高她的枪，

在这里，我们走了。

00:10:46,788 - > 00:10:47,986 
不要“在这里，我们走”我。

202 
00:10:47,986 - > 00:10:49,978 
我不得不做的一切，鲍比。

首先，你抱怨，我是预约一切

205 
00:10:53,028 - > 00:10:54,907 
我的意思是教会和死去的母亲的礼服。 
I meant the church and your dead mother's dress.

但是，当它涉及到做真正的工作，你只是不能被人打扰。 
But when it comes to doing the real work, you just can't be bothered.

207 
00:10:58,017 - > 00:10:59,614 
好吧，我现在很困扰。 
Well, I'm bothered now. 

208 
00:11:00,543 - > 00:11:02,904 
我不认为你甚至想结婚。 
I don't think you even want to be married. 

209 
00:11:02,904 - > 00:11:03,805 
在这里，我们走！ 
Here we go!! 

210 
00:11:03,805 - > 00:11:05,015 
不要“在这里，我们走”！ 
Don't "here we go" me!

211 
00:11:05,015 - > 00:11:07,544 
如果你“在这里，我们去”我更多的时间，我要尖叫，好吗？ 
If you "here we go" me one more time I am going to scream, okay?

你听到了吗？ 
Do you hear me?

听自己的！

"Here we go" and "Listen to yourself".

If you ever say those in our marriage, I will scream!! Okay?

00:11:15,459 - > 00:11:17,548 
它的好成为夫妻之前，我们知道这些事情。

218

你知道，这是非常，非常健康！ 
You know, this is very, very healthy!

219 
00:11:21,186 - > 00:11:22,172 
问题！ 
Bug off! 

220 
00:11:24,932 - > 00:11:29,583 
嘛。这是很好的知道你可以让她尖叫。 
Well. It's nice to know you can make her scream. 

221 
00:11:33,655 - > 00:11:36,032 
正如你可以看到，我们远远不够。 
As you can see, we were back far enough. 

222 
00:11:36,748 - > 00:11:38,512 
在那里，她得到了她的车。 
There she's getting out of her car. 

223 
00:11:38,512 - > 00:11:40,655 
她得到的东西在她的外套。

她在街对面。 
She's moving across the street. 

225 
00:11:42,838 - > 00:11:45,474 
警察在大街上，所以有没有人阻止她。 
The police were all on the street, so there's no one stop her. 

226 
00:11:46,092 - > 00:11:47,526 
好吧，说到这里。 
Ok, here it comes. 

227 
00:11:47,526 - > 00:11:50,306 
她拉起武器，砰，砰。

她丢弃的武器，并把她的双手。

她的人员解决。

230 
00:11:56,046 - > 00:11:58,059 
这几乎是它。 
That's pretty much it. 

231 
00:12:06,233 - > 00:12:07,746 
你什么意思你不能tesitify？ 
What do you mean you can't tesitify? 

232 
00:12:07,746 - > 00:12:10,479 
你看，我没想到她是疯狂的开始。 
Look, I didn't think she was insane to begin with. 

233 
00:12:10,479 - > 00:12:12,765 
我正准备说她可能已经。 
I was prepared to say she might have been. 

234 
00:12:12,765 - > 00:12:14,141 
那么，是什么改变了呢？ 
So, what's changed? 

235 
00:12:14,141 - > 00:12:15,203 
带我刚才看到的。 
That tape I just saw. 

236 
00:12:15,203 - > 00:12:16,308 
我还没有看到过。 
I haven't seen it before. 

237 
00:12:16,308 - > 00:12:18,923 
很明显，她是平静的，由。 
And clearly, she is calm, composed. 

238 
00:12:18,923 - > 00:12:20,631 
这并不意味着她是不是在愤怒。 
That doesn't mean she wasn't in a rage. 

239 
00:12:20,631 - > 00:12:21,393 
也许她是， 
Maybe she was, 

240 
00:12:21,393 - > 00:12:24,861 
但你问我作证，她不能明辨是非。 
but you're asking me to testify she couldn't distinguish right from wrong. 

241 
00:12:24,861 - > 00:12:26,​​824 
我不能说。 
I can't say that. 

242 
00:12:26,​​824 - > 00:12:28,472 
她把她的手在她的头上，

243

后非常平静，她射击那些镜头。 
very calmly after she fired those shots. 

244 
00:12:30,659 - > 00:12:33,225 
这告诉我，她有望被逮捕。 
That tells me she expected to be arrested.

245 
00:12:33,225 - > 00:12:35,819 
它告诉我，她知道她在做什么是错的。 
It tells me she knew what she was doing was wrong. 

246 
00:12:35,819 - > 00:12:37,188 
哦，来吧。 
Oh, come on. 

247 
00:12:37,188 - > 00:12:39,606 
这种防御是一片开始，Ellenor。 
This defense was a stretch to begin with, Ellenor. 

248 
00:12:39,606 - > 00:12:41,266 
我无法延伸那么远。 
I can't stretch it that far. 

249

你面前。 
You have before.

肯定不会在电视上。

我公司有专业的声誉，

253 
00:12:47,562 - > 00:12:48,615 
你想过这一点吗？

254 
00:12:48,615 - > 00:12:50,252 
想想吧，我们付你。 
Think about it, we're paying you for it. 

255 
00:12:50,252 - > 00:12:52,035 
我们给你10000美元。

260 
00:13:00,251 - > 00:13:01,843 
我想这样做。 
I would be doing so.

你不希望要介绍我的意见。

264 
00:13:20,941 - > 00:13:22,097 
现在怎么办？ 
Now what? 

265 
00:13:24,350 - > 00:13:25,784 
我们得到了医生兰宁。 
We got doctor Lanning. 

266 
00:13:26,392 - > 00:13:27,844 
医生涂料？ 
Doctor dope? 

267 
00:13:27,844 - > 00:13:29,850 
至少，他会说我们想做什么。 
At least he'll say what we want. 

268 
00:13:30,752 - > 00:13:32,762 
这下好了。 
This is just great. 

269 
00:13:39,122 - > 00:13:41,058 
我觉得我应该拿她的十字架。 
I think I should take her cross. 

270 
00:13:41,597 - > 00:13:42,545 
为什么呢？ 
Why? 

271 
00:13:42,545 - > 00:13:46,162 
没有违法，但我只是觉得我能比你更同情。 
No offense, but I just think I'm able to come off more sympathetic than you. 

272 
00:13:46,162 - > 00:13:47,781 
你呢？交感神经？ 
You? Sympathetic?
