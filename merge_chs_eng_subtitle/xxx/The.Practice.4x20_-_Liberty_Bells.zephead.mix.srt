00:28:52,397 - > 00:28:54,516 
该供述仍然站立。 
that confession still stands.

465 
00:28:54,516 - > 00:28:58,734 
它被引入到审判和证据在审判中的挑战。

他们不¡¯吨。

00:29:05,663 - > 00:29:07,989 
他们可以说他们想要的一切，是捏造的 
They can argue all they want that is fabricated 

470 
00:29:07,989 - > 00:29:12,354 
这样的说法是在审判，陪审团拒绝。 
that argument was made at trial and rejected by the jury.

471 
00:29:12,354 - > 00:29:14,919 
其次，目击者的证词。 
Second, the eyewitnesss testimony.

同样，辩方辩称审判意有所指Brasal先生被误认为 
Again, the defence argued at trial that Mr. Brasal must've been mistaken 

473 
00:29:19,629 - > 00:29:23,876 
但并没有什么别的controvert，目击者的证词。 
but there is nothing else to controvert that eyewitnesss testimony.

474 
00:29:23,876 - > 00:29:26,997

如果你看看在法庭笔录

如果审查结案陈词

00:29:36,858 - > 00:29:39,981 
你会看到，我们敲定了两点：

480 
00:29:39,981 - > 00:29:42,724 
供述和目击者的证词。 
The confession and the eyewitnesss testimony.

现在，我们都可以说在这些点上，我绝不会同意陪审团 
Now, we can all say I would never agree with the jury on those points 

482 
00:29:48,069 - > 00:29:51,895 
但这不是标准进行审查。 
but that is not the standard for a review.

483 
00:29:51,895 - > 00:29:53,807 
你要问的问题 
The question you have to ask 

484 
00:29:53,807 - > 00:29:57,583 
这些新的证据是否是这样的性格， 
is whether these new evidence is of such character 

485 
00:29:57,583 - > 00:30:01,193 
，可能会导致不同的判决。 
that a different verdict will likely result.

486 
00:30:01,788 - > 00:30:04,542 
这个问题的答案是否定的。 
The answer to that is no.

487 
00:30:04,542 - > 00:30:10,220 
因为有什么反驳的供述，或者他的见证。 
Because there is nothing to disprove either the confession or that testimony.

488 
00:30:10,220 - > 00:30:14,500 
那么，不是现在。 
Not then, not now.

489 
00:30:16,126 - > 00:30:18,671 
好吧，我就满足你，斯坦菲尔德先生。 
All right, I will grant you that, Mr. Stanfield. 

490 
00:30:18,671 - > 00:30:21,368 
法院没有依据扔出去的告白

491 
00:30:21,368 - > 00:30:23,308 
或目击者的证词。 
or the eyewitnesss testimony.

492

但这种新的DNA证据

493 
00:30:27,830 - > 00:30:30,476 
不¯吨，别人告诉我们做到了吗？ 
doesnt that tell us somebody else did it?

494

我们没有时间轴上，本来可以更早。 
We have no timeline on that, could have been earlier.

498 
00:30:39,324 - > 00:30:42,366 
但它没有改变我们的基本面情况。 
But it doesnt change the fundamentals of our case.

499 
00:30:42,366 - > 00:30:43,667 
而让¡¯记住这

多诺万先生没¡¯承认泰勒先生 
Mr. Donovan didnt confessed to Mr. Tylor

他只承认谋杀两名妇女。 
He confessed only to murdering the two women.

503 
00:30:55,244 - > 00:30:57,228 
因此，这个新的证据，什么也不做

破坏该供述的真实性。

你还认为他吗？

506 
00:31:01,817 - > 00:31:03,248 
我个人的信念是不相关的。 
My personal beliefs aren't relevant.

507

有我有关。
