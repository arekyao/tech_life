42 
00:01:33,508 - > 00:01:34,811 
但我们不能获得该测试

43 
00:01:34,811 - > 00:01:37,068 
除非我们证明他是无辜的第一？

右。 
Right. 

45 
00:01:38,391 - > 00:01:39,573 
到底怎么会这样呢？ 
How the hell can that be?! 

46 
00:01:39,573 - > 00:01:40,397 
我不知道， 
I don't know, 

47 
00:01:40,397 - > 00:01:43,932 
但斯图尔特·多诺万被设置为在17天死亡， 
but Stuart Donovan is set to be put to death in 17 days, 

48 
00:01:43,932 - > 00:01:45,773 
因此，这意味着现在，然后之间 
so that means between now and then 

49 
00:01:45,773 - > 00:01:49,244 
我们必须以某种方式证明他是无辜的。

她认为你娶她获得监护权

196 
00:08:59,328 - > 00:09:01,083 
所以你可以将她从家里。

我和她结婚，因为我爱她，

她不是目击者这里。

是考虑医疗，是不是？ 
that is something to consider medically as well, isn't it? 

268 
00:12:32,850 - > 00:12:35,141 
这不是唯一要考虑的。鉴于她的年龄...

271 
00:12:39,838 - > 00:12:41,862 
尤其是当他爱她吗？

她更好的生活与他在一家养老院，是不是她？ 
she's better off living with him than in a nursing home, isn't she? 

275 
00:12:54,379 - > 00:12:56,288 
这是一个非常大的'如果'。 
That's a very big 'if'. 

276 
00:12:57,390 - > 00:12:59,374 
但是很可能，是的。

288 
00:13:35,418 - > 00:13:39,479 
我想要问你们几个问题。 
I'd like to ask you just a couple of questions. 

289 
00:13:43,166 - > 00:13:44,869 
我正在上夜班， 
I was working the graveyard shift, 

290 
00:13:44,869 - > 00:13:46,781 
但我记得在我离开之前

我的妻子试图平息阿利萨。

你知道为什么吗？

阿利萨已经打破了斯图尔特的前几天，

294 
00:13:55,262 - > 00:13:58,084 
他打电话给她，骚扰她。

她非常不高兴。

296 
00:14:03,407 - > 00:14:05,727 
我没有把它当回事，虽然。

00:14:05,727 - > 00:14:10,467 
而当我回到家的时候，看到他做了什么给她。 
And when I came home, and saw what he had done to her. 

298 
00:14:11,580 - > 00:14:14,910 
这可能是部分听起来进攻， 
This may be the part that sounds offensive, 

299 
00:14:14,910 - > 00:14:18,401 
但你能想到的别人 
but can you think of anybody else 

300 
00:14:18,401 - > 00:14:22,354 
谁可能想伤害你的女儿或你的妻子吗？

310 
00:15:0​​0,269 - > 00:15:0​​2,732 
我知道你想关闭的，先生， 
I understand you want closure, sir, 

311 
00:15:0​​3,701 - > 00:15:0​​5,728 
但如果他没有做到这一点， 
but if he didn't do it, 

312 
00:15:0​​6,823 - > 00:15:0​​9,193 
当他们处死他，就是这样。 
when they execute him, that's it. 

313 
00:15:0​​9,193 - > 00:15:12,200 
他们得到了真正的凶手Berluti的先生。

特纳先生...

法官已经明确表示，他需要听到从她。 
The Judge has made it clear he needs to hear from her. 

319 
00:15:27,700 - > 00:15:31,271 
我会尽我所能保护她，但她作证。 
I'll try my best to protect her, but she has to testify. 

320 
00:15:31,271 - > 00:15:34,169 
你为什么不停止你的大惊小怪？ 
Why don't you two stop your fussing? 

321

00:16:57,739 - > 00:17:00,604 
真的吗？他为什么要这么做？

343 
00:17:00,604 - > 00:17:03,240 
有良心攻击我猜。

似乎发生在你身边有很多，不是吗？

你是一个小偷和一个武装强盗，

好了，我们得到了前妻的证人誓章饮用。 
Well, we got the ex wife's affidavit on the witnesses drinking. 

559

几乎没有。 
Hardly.

她说，你打他的头。 
She said you hit him on the head. 

577 
00:27:19,466 - > 00:27:21,206 
这样做，从哪儿冒出来？ 
Did that come out of nowhere? 

578 
00:27:21,206 - > 00:27:24,256 
是。男子下跌。

从废标诉讼。 
from the annulment proceeding. 

591 
00:27:53,620 - > 00:27:57,122 
他们很可能满足可能的原因。 
They could probably satisfy probable cause with that. 

592 
00:27:57,122 - > 00:27:59,223 
但他们无法定罪就可以了，对不对？ 
But they couldn't convict on it, right? 

593 
00:28:02,240 - > 00:28:04,093 
如果你以避免审判， 
If you're to avoid a trial,

00:28:05,658 - > 00:28:09,355 
最好的事情是格特鲁德作证在可能的原因

786 
00:36:30,207 - > 00:36:35,945 
对面这么多遍的脸像。 
Right across the face like so many times before. 

787 
00:36:37,184 - > 00:36:43,167

793 
00:37:02,856 - > 00:37:06,954 
“你把你的手给我” 
"you take your hand to me"

794 
00:37:11,768 - > 00:37:18,241 
我不是故意杀他，只是扑打他下来。 
I didn't mean to kill him, just swat him down. 

795 
00:37:19,415 - > 00:37:21,269 
你打你的丈夫吗？ 
You hit your husband? 

796 
00:37:22,163 - > 00:37:27,649 
和亚瑟走了进来，说：“我们只是说他摔倒”

800 
00:37:46,734 - > 00:37:51,646 
什么，你为什么说亚瑟做到了吗？

有时候，我觉得他做到了。 
Sometimes I think he did. 

802 
00:38:01,453 - > 00:38:03,618 
我感到困惑。 
I get confused. 

803 
00:38:07,274 - > 00:38:09,093 
我觉得 
I think 

804 
00:38:11,320 - > 00:38:14,881

"how could I have..."

805 
00:38:26,361 - > 00:38:28,112

她开始谈论它。

00:39:20,082 - > 00:39:24,225 
我不得不让她走出那家之前，她让自己陷入麻烦。 
I had to get her out of that home before she got herself into trouble. 

811 
00:39:26,356 - > 00:39:28,603 
所以，这就是为什么你娶了她， 
So that's why you married her, 

812 
00:39:28,603 - > 00:39:31,040 
让她之前，她说太多？
