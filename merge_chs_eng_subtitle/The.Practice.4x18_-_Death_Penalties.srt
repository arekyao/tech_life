1
00:00:02,026 --> 00:00:03,620
We have to make a decision. 

2
00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:05,607
What do you think ? 

3
00:00:05,607 --> 00:00:08,329
I think if we can get manslaughter we should take it. 

4
00:00:08,329 --> 00:00:10,219
How much time would I serve? 

5
00:00:10,832 --> 00:00:12,689
It could be as little as three years. 

6
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:15,554
I would think at the most six. 

7
00:00:15,554 --> 00:00:17,421
God, 

8
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:21,212
my kids are 13 and 11

9
00:00:22,467 --> 00:00:23,833
six years! 

10
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:26,143
Here is the problem, jury nullification is risky. 

11
00:00:26,143 --> 00:00:28,530
Technically I’m not even allowed to argue it. 

12
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,511
What about insanity? 

13
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:32,646
The problem there is 

14
00:00:32,646 --> 00:00:35,691
your demeanor was calm and deliberate at the time. 

15
00:00:35,691 --> 00:00:38,759
Now look, Helen Gamble is a very good DA, 

16
00:00:39,645 --> 00:00:42,905
also on this issue, she is on a mission with it. 

17
00:00:42,905 --> 00:00:44,857
Her grandmother, I don’t know all the details, 

18
00:00:44,857 --> 00:00:47,239
was euthanized somehow. 

19
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:50,405
All I know is she goes tough on mercy killings. 

20
00:00:50,405 --> 00:00:52,736
This was an act of compassion for God’s sake. 

21
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,591
You know that, I know that, 

22
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:58,228
but if we can get manslaughter I think we should do it. 

23
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,785
I can’t believe they are pushing this. 

24
00:01:01,785 --> 00:01:03,075
This is politics. 

25
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,458
You did shoot her in the head.

26
00:01:11,124 --> 00:01:15,381

时间轴：美溪客

28
00:01:55,023 --> 00:01:56,258
I’m not offering manslaughter. 

29
00:01:56,258 --> 00:01:57,142
It’s a mercy killing. 

30
00:01:57,142 --> 00:01:57,961
It’s a homicide. 

31
00:01:57,961 --> 00:01:59,312
I’m agreeing to plead homicide 

32
00:01:59,312 --> 00:02:00,399
Not enough you are not 

33
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,562
What are you looking for, a life sentence? 

34
00:02:01,562 --> 00:02:02,700
This man is no criminal. 

35
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,301
I’m looking for more than five years, 

36
00:02:04,301 --> 00:02:06,831
which is what he would probably do with manslaughter. 

37
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:08,107
And he is a criminal Bobby, 

38
00:02:08,107 --> 00:02:09,545
he committed premeditated murder 

39
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:11,985
what I’m suppose to go light because it came from love. 

40
00:02:11,985 --> 00:02:13,184
A lot of homicides do. 

41
00:02:13,184 --> 00:02:14,799
Listen to how angry you are getting. 

42
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:16,247
I’ll see you in there. 

43
00:02:16,247 --> 00:02:18,238
Hey, get some therapy. 

44
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,555
Take your hand off me, please. 

45
00:02:22,222 --> 00:02:24,244
I tried talking to her last night. 

46
00:02:25,285 --> 00:02:26,301
So what do we do? 

47
00:02:26,301 --> 00:02:28,668
I still wouldn’t go insanity, she’ll pick us apart 

48
00:02:28,668 --> 00:02:30,558
plus it’s pretty obvious he knew what he was doing. 

49
00:02:30,558 --> 00:02:32,142
So what are we left with? 

50
00:02:35,063 --> 00:02:36,623
Self-defense? 

51
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:37,483
It’s viable

52
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:41,704
You want to argue he defended his wife by shooting her in the head? 

53
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:43,141
I should at least be allowed to argue it! 

54
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:44,513
Well you won’t be. 

55
00:02:44,513 --> 00:02:47,418
I have to prevent the law from being tortured here. 

56
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:49,176
If you consider the strict elements here...

57
00:02:49,176 --> 00:02:53,412
You will not argue that he acted in self-defense, that is ridiculous. 

58
00:02:53,412 --> 00:02:54,376
What else? 

59
00:02:54,376 --> 00:02:58,694
We’d ask the prosecution to include manslaughter as a lesser included charge 

60
00:02:58,694 --> 00:03:01,010
It wasn’t manslaughter it was premeditated and... 

61
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,067
Question for the jury. 

62
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:05,978
The jury doesn’t get to decide what defendants are charged with. 

63
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:07,667
The reason she won’t charge manslaughter is 

64
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,820
she’s afraid that is what the jury will come back with. 

65
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,756
I can’t tell the prosecution what to charge counsel. 

66
00:03:12,756 --> 00:03:13,314
Your honor...

67
00:03:13,314 --> 00:03:14,087
Bobby 

68
00:03:17,177 --> 00:03:18,070
Let’s go in...

69
00:03:18,544 --> 00:03:20,820
Ms. Gamble, one second please. 

70
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:28,754
As I’ve said, I can’t tell you how to prosecute your case, 

71
00:03:28,754 --> 00:03:32,188
but it seems manslaughter is a good result here. 

72
00:03:32,188 --> 00:03:33,153
I don’t agree. 

73
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,139
A jury could let him go free. 

74
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:38,770
I’m aware of that possibility, your honor. 

75
00:03:47,786 --> 00:03:48,711
May I help you?

76
00:03:49,137 --> 00:03:50,803
I'm Mary Donovon.

77
00:03:50,803 --> 00:03:54,903
I'm looking for Bobby Donnell, Eugene Yong or Ellenor Frutt.

78
00:03:54,903 --> 00:03:56,173
I’m Eleanor Frutt 

79
00:03:56,173 --> 00:03:59,597
Oh, hello. It’s very nice to meet you. 

80
00:03:59,597 --> 00:04:01,496
You come highly recommended. 

81
00:04:02,461 --> 00:04:05,580
I have $500, I would like to buy a day of your time. 

82
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,409
$500 will get you to lunch. 

83
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:10,149
Is there something specific... 

84
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:13,288
My son, he’s in jail for a crime he didn’t commit. 

85
00:04:14,263 --> 00:04:15,366
Well...

86
00:04:15,366 --> 00:04:18,251
Yes, every mother thinks her son is innocent. 

87
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:20,618
The distinction here mine is. 

88
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:23,320
If I could just have one day. 

89
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,759
If it’s more than $500 I can pay overtime 

90
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,653
Can you tell me the crime your son has been convicted of? 

91
00:04:28,653 --> 00:04:29,577
Murder. 

92
00:04:29,577 --> 00:04:31,935
He’s on death row in Pennsylvania. 

93
00:04:31,935 --> 00:04:33,824
The governor just signed his warrant. 

94
00:04:33,824 --> 00:04:36,130
He’s to be executed in five weeks, 

95
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,578
so time is of the essence. 

96
00:04:39,694 --> 00:04:40,730
Please.

97
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:43,487
I'm only asking for one day.

98
00:04:51,672 --> 00:04:53,775
What do you do as a hospice worker? 

99
00:04:53,775 --> 00:04:55,300
It’s much like that of nurse, 

100
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,515
though I work primarily with dying patients. 

101
00:04:57,515 --> 00:04:59,313
Usually at their own homes. 

102
00:04:59,313 --> 00:05:01,568
You worked for Scott Simpson, the defendant. 

103
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:03,905
Yes, I looked after his wife. 

104
00:05:03,905 --> 00:05:06,282
She was suffering from ovarian cancer. 

105
00:05:07,054 --> 00:05:07,649
Mrs. Raymonds, 

106
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:11,692
calling your attention to the evening of Dec. 5 of last year, 

107
00:05:11,692 --> 00:05:13,835
do you recall what happened. 

108
00:05:13,835 --> 00:05:15,213
She was in a lot of pain. 

109
00:05:15,213 --> 00:05:16,462
Mrs. Simpson? 

110
00:05:16,462 --> 00:05:20,231
Yes, we were giving her increased dosages of morphine, 

111
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:21,826
but she was still in agony. 

112
00:05:21,826 --> 00:05:24,010
She was begging that we let her die. 

113
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,261
Finally, Mr. Simpson, he um, 

114
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:30,390
he asked that I leave the room, which I did. 

115
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,137
Then what happened? 

116
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:36,952
After about two minutes or so, I heard a gun shot 

117
00:05:38,516 --> 00:05:41,046
Mr. Simpson then opened the door 

118
00:05:41,046 --> 00:05:43,098
and he said his wife was gone. 

119
00:05:46,044 --> 00:05:47,781
You spoke of morphine. 

120
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:49,112
Actually on the day in question 

121
00:05:49,112 --> 00:05:51,022
you were using morphine in conjunction 

122
00:05:51,022 --> 00:05:52,146
with a benzyl diasapine, 

123
00:05:52,146 --> 00:05:53,173
isn’t that right? 

124
00:05:53,173 --> 00:05:53,727
Yes. 

125
00:05:53,727 --> 00:05:56,449
This drug is the equivalent of valium.

126
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:58,035
It’s very close, yes. 

127
00:05:58,035 --> 00:06:00,269
The purpose of the morphine valium cocktail 

128
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:03,164
is to hasten the patient’s death. 

129
00:06:03,164 --> 00:06:04,433
Isn’t that right, Mrs. Raymond? 

130
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:06,374
It’s primarily to relieve pain. 

131
00:06:06,374 --> 00:06:08,324
Mrs. Raymonds, I remind you, 

132
00:06:08,324 --> 00:06:09,188
you are under oath. 

133
00:06:09,188 --> 00:06:12,012
The morphine valium combination 

134
00:06:12,012 --> 00:06:16,177
that is used to cause the patient’s death. True? 

135
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:18,178
Yes. 

136
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,200
So on the day in question 

137
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,422
you were already acting to hasten Mrs. Simpson’s death , 

138
00:06:23,422 --> 00:06:24,072
weren’t you? 

139
00:06:24,072 --> 00:06:27,089
In conjunction with the family’s wishes, 

140
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:31,061
I was employing a method of pain management 

141
00:06:31,061 --> 00:06:34,546
that would most likely result in the patient’s death, yes. 

142
00:06:34,546 --> 00:06:37,639
And no one charged you with attempted murder I assume ? 

143
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,471
Objection. 

144
00:06:38,471 --> 00:06:39,397
Sustained. 

145
00:06:39,397 --> 00:06:42,790
When Mr. Simpson ended his wife’s life 

146
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,502
he did something in seconds 

147
00:06:45,502 --> 00:06:48,448
that you were basically trying to do in a day or so? 

148
00:06:49,261 --> 00:06:51,820
I can’t disagree with that. 

149
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,354
Thank you. 

150
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,074
He was only 19 at the time. 

151
00:07:00,074 --> 00:07:04,264
He’s convicted of raping and killing his girlfriend, Alyssa Kearns, 

152
00:07:04,264 --> 00:07:06,032
then killing her mother. 

153
00:07:07,516 --> 00:07:08,877
This is them. 

154
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:13,912
And this happened when? 

155
00:07:13,912 --> 00:07:17,061
In 1988, he’s been in prison 12 years. 

156
00:07:18,654 --> 00:07:22,384
The evidence was one eyewitness who placed him at the scene, 

157
00:07:22,384 --> 00:07:24,096
plus a lying jail house informant 

158
00:07:24,096 --> 00:07:26,057
who made up a story about Stuart confessing. 

159
00:07:26,057 --> 00:07:27,124
He never did. 

160
00:07:27,124 --> 00:07:28,769
And what is your son’s story? 

161
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:30,090
That he was out hunting. 

162
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,441
And it’s not a story. 

163
00:07:31,441 --> 00:07:32,944
He was with my husband, 

164
00:07:32,944 --> 00:07:35,768
who the police just thought was trying to cover for him. 

165
00:07:35,768 --> 00:07:37,617
My husband has since passed away. 

166
00:07:38,572 --> 00:07:40,005
Any DNA? 

167
00:07:40,005 --> 00:07:42,727
Stuart’s blood type matched whoever did it. 

168
00:07:42,727 --> 00:07:43,793
That’s a problem. 

169
00:07:43,793 --> 00:07:46,801
They didn’t do full DNA analysis back then. 

170
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:47,888
Never? 

171
00:07:47,888 --> 00:07:50,417
In 1992 we finally had it done, 

172
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:53,922
unfortunately the tests proved inconclusive. 

173
00:07:53,922 --> 00:07:56,329
We went to try again in 95, 

174
00:07:56,329 --> 00:08:01,602
but by then the rape kit had either been lost or destroyed. 

175
00:08:01,602 --> 00:08:04,700
What is his appellate lawyer telling you? 

176
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,433
That he’s done all he can do. 

177
00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:10,923
You took it? 

178
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:13,976
I agreed to meet with her son and the DA if I can. 

179
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:15,043
In Pennsylvania. 

180
00:08:15,043 --> 00:08:16,055
It’s a hour and a half flight. 

181
00:08:16,055 --> 00:08:17,264
I’m there and back in a day. 

182
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:20,893
And you know, who knows, if he really is innocent...

183
00:08:21,753 --> 00:08:23,440
God bless you Eleanor. 

184
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,686
If I had your heart. 

185
00:08:24,686 --> 00:08:25,914
You’d have a heart. 

186
00:08:25,914 --> 00:08:26,778
Oh, funny 

187
00:08:26,778 --> 00:08:29,015
Ok, look, Can I ask you something 

188
00:08:29,015 --> 00:08:31,971
and I’m not trying to pick a fight here , I promise. 

189
00:08:33,982 --> 00:08:35,972
Why not plead out on manslaughter. 

190
00:08:35,972 --> 00:08:36,686
Grieving husband, 

191
00:08:36,686 --> 00:08:39,959
and I don’t believe you really believe this guy is a danger to society. 

192
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:41,096
He does time...

193
00:08:41,096 --> 00:08:42,336
He shot her in the head. 

194
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:45,272
Is it the method then? The fact that he used a gun? 

195
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,091
Partly, yes. 

196
00:08:48,091 --> 00:08:50,571
So if he used a needle 

197
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,593
and injected her with something to put her to sleep 

198
00:08:52,593 --> 00:08:53,832
then you would agree to manslaughter. 

199
00:08:55,646 --> 00:08:58,332
No, seems even less like manslaughter. 

200
00:08:58,332 --> 00:09:00,028
You put dogs to sleep not people. 

201
00:09:00,028 --> 00:09:01,695
Ok, so agreed it’s a crime. 

202
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:06,053
But my question goes to why murder two, why not manslaughter? 

203
00:09:06,053 --> 00:09:07,201
Let me ask you a question. 

204
00:09:08,217 --> 00:09:09,751
You are against the death penalty 

205
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:10,782
you say it’s barbaric. 

206
00:09:10,782 --> 00:09:12,728
It’s okay to put sick people to death 

207
00:09:12,728 --> 00:09:13,849
but not convicted murderers? 

208
00:09:13,849 --> 00:09:15,729
No, those are two very different things 

209
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:16,304
No they are not. 

210
00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:17,991
Lethal injections in both cases. 

211
00:09:18,794 --> 00:09:20,517
Look, there is a very big difference 

212
00:09:20,517 --> 00:09:22,162
between executing a healthy person 

213
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:24,885
and allowing a terminal one in pain to die. 

214
00:09:24,885 --> 00:09:26,917
Mrs. Simpson wasn’t allowed to die 

215
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:28,700
she had a bullet pumped into her head. 

216
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,808
She wanted to die. 

217
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:33,191
Oh, is that the test, whether she wants to die. 

218
00:09:33,191 --> 00:09:35,710
Cause a lot of inmates on death row, they want to die. 

219
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,116
You support killing them? 

220
00:09:37,116 --> 00:09:39,037
I’m talking about a dying woman in extreme...

221
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,897
Please don’t shake your fork at me. 

222
00:09:40,897 --> 00:09:42,406
What about the guy with a brain tumor 

223
00:09:42,406 --> 00:09:44,265
who is got four to six months to live? 

224
00:09:44,265 --> 00:09:47,000
He’s not suffering, but he doesn’t want it to ever get to that point 

225
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,462
so he’d rather die now. 

226
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,910
Is it okay to kill him if he wants? 

227
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,129
Well I think we need to reevaluate... 

228
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:52,056
How about the ones with six months to live? 

229
00:09:52,056 --> 00:09:54,458
I’m not saying it’s okay to kill anybody, I’m only say…. 

230
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:55,084
Okay, well fine. 

231
00:09:55,084 --> 00:09:57,917
You make a list of who it’s okay to kill and who its not, all right?? 

232
00:09:57,917 --> 00:09:59,452
Oh, Helen, Stop it. 

233
00:10:00,087 --> 00:10:01,982
This woman was in extreme agony 

234
00:10:01,982 --> 00:10:04,532
her husband was trying to spare her some suffering 

235
00:10:04,532 --> 00:10:06,559
and you go after him like he’s some monster. 

236
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,748
I’m suppose to listen to you 

237
00:10:07,748 --> 00:10:10,073
on who’s a sympathetic defendant and who's not? 

238
00:10:10,073 --> 00:10:12,873
Forgive me if I don’t trust your damn judgement 

239
00:10:12,873 --> 00:10:15,149
and thank you for allowing me to enjoy my supper. 

240
00:10:21,656 --> 00:10:23,860
I was just making conversation. 

241
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,660
Last week she had been in unbearable pain. 

242
00:10:33,489 --> 00:10:35,418
She was tough, Sally, 

243
00:10:37,497 --> 00:10:41,621
she had endured a year of massive chemotherapy treatments. 

244
00:10:42,281 --> 00:10:45,207
Lets talk about the very last day. 

245
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:48,321
She just couldn’t take it anymore. 

246
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:52,598
We then started the morphine with the valium, 

247
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,817
Mrs. Raymonds said she would probably go into a coma 

248
00:10:57,817 --> 00:10:59,290
and die in a day or two.

249
00:11:00,164 --> 00:11:02,013
The pain wouldn’t go away. 

250
00:11:03,101 --> 00:11:04,402
What did you do? 

251
00:11:06,281 --> 00:11:09,369
I asked Mrs. Raymonds to increase the morphine. 

252
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,300
She said she didn’t want to throw her into seizures 

253
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,906
because that would be more pain. 

254
00:11:14,511 --> 00:11:17,274
So I asked her to leave the room. 

255
00:11:18,128 --> 00:11:19,377
Then what happened 

256
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:21,671
I went to my closet, 

257
00:11:22,285 --> 00:11:24,610
retrieved my revolver from the safe 

258
00:11:27,499 --> 00:11:28,627
and...

259
00:11:29,571 --> 00:11:31,585
I ...

260
00:11:34,064 --> 00:11:35,405
ended it.

261
00:11:38,494 --> 00:11:42,890
She would have likely been dead in a day, why? 

262
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:48,284
I wasn’t going to let her suffer for another second. 

263
00:11:48,284 --> 00:11:55,202
For two years, they cut out half her insides 

264
00:11:55,202 --> 00:11:57,124
filled her with chemicals. 

265
00:11:57,124 --> 00:11:58,716
And the pain. 

266
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:06,188
Not another minute, not another second, 

267
00:12:06,188 --> 00:12:09,084
not another second... 

268
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:45,823
I have a meeting with the District Attorney in a little over an hour, 

269
00:12:45,823 --> 00:12:47,637
so I read your statements 

270
00:12:47,637 --> 00:12:49,667
but I’d like to hear in person your account of things. 

271
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:52,369
Okay, it’s pretty simple. 

272
00:12:53,121 --> 00:12:55,660
I was there that day because I needed to see her. 

273
00:12:55,956 --> 00:12:56,942
Why? 

274
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,533
We argued earlier that week. 

275
00:12:58,533 --> 00:12:59,925
She wasn’t returning my calls. 

276
00:13:00,391 --> 00:13:03,287
She said we needed to take a break so I left. 

277
00:13:04,364 --> 00:13:06,568
That night I went hunting with my dad, 

278
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,003
the next day the police showed up. 

279
00:13:09,003 --> 00:13:11,665
Did you make love to Alyssa that afternoon? 

280
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:12,985
No. 

281
00:13:12,985 --> 00:13:15,037
And did you see her mother? 

282
00:13:15,555 --> 00:13:16,973
No, not that day. 

283
00:13:23,535 --> 00:13:24,957
Do we have a chance? 

284
00:13:32,241 --> 00:13:36,710
When a patient reaches stage four of ovarian cancer, it’s pretty bleak. 

285
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,880
The odds of survival are tougher, yes 

286
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,326
But you were generally encouraging to Mrs. Simpson, 

287
00:13:41,326 --> 00:13:42,052
weren’t you, doctor? 

288
00:13:42,052 --> 00:13:43,373
I don’t know if I was optimistic 

289
00:13:43,373 --> 00:13:45,538
But you certainly held out the hope that the chemo treatments, 

290
00:13:45,538 --> 00:13:48,525
her pushing fluids plus the two surgeries to debalk the cancer, 

291
00:13:48,525 --> 00:13:50,018
it could maybe save her. 

292
00:13:50,018 --> 00:13:51,371
That was the best chance 

293
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:56,644
But there never was any real chance of saving Mrs. Simpson’s life, 

294
00:13:56,644 --> 00:13:57,884
was there, Dr. Sheehans? 

295
00:13:57,884 --> 00:14:02,201
Objection, Mrs. Simpson’s oncologist has nothing to do with what transpired. 

296
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:05,852
It is my contention that this doctor contributed to Mrs. Simpson’s suffering. 

297
00:14:05,852 --> 00:14:07,541
That goes to my client’s state of mind. 

298
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:08,263
Hold on here... 

299
00:14:08,263 --> 00:14:10,733
Scott Simpson was the only one to help his wife. 

300
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:12,389
The doctors weren’t there in the end. 

301
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:15,127
This witness is not relevant to the issue before this court. 

302
00:14:15,127 --> 00:14:16,457
I will show relevance. 

303
00:14:16,457 --> 00:14:17,741
You are shut down here. 

304
00:14:17,741 --> 00:14:18,855
Step down, doctor. 

305
00:14:19,587 --> 00:14:21,049
Call your next witness. 

306
00:14:23,052 --> 00:14:25,419
The defense calls Dr. Alan Price. 

307
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:26,191
Objection. 

308
00:14:26,191 --> 00:14:27,501
Step up. 

309
00:14:33,689 --> 00:14:34,796
Offer of proof. 

310
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:38,220
Dr. Price is the surgeon who did the debulking procedures. 

311
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,414
Denied. This witness is not relevant. 

312
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:41,349
Your honor. 

313
00:14:41,349 --> 00:14:43,786
I would remind counsel that it is your client 

314
00:14:43,786 --> 00:14:44,813
that is on trial here, 

315
00:14:44,813 --> 00:14:46,844
not the doctors who treated his wife 

316
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,953
My client should be allowed to put on a defense 

317
00:14:49,953 --> 00:14:51,558
You are not putting on this one. 

318
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:53,363
Who else have you got? 

319
00:14:53,363 --> 00:14:55,151
Defense rests, your honor. 

320
00:14:58,117 --> 00:14:59,692
Defense rests. 

321
00:15:05,392 --> 00:15:07,129
As I told Mrs. Donovan, 

322
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:08,882
we don’t know what became of the rape kit. 

323
00:15:08,882 --> 00:15:10,310
Oh please. 

324
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,570
Do you know where it could have become loss? 

325
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,522
It should be in the police’s evidence room, 

326
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:16,646
if not there, I’d try the lab, 

327
00:15:16,646 --> 00:15:17,368
barring that...

328
00:15:17,368 --> 00:15:18,445
Why aren’t you trying? 

329
00:15:18,445 --> 00:15:20,179
Why are you so blasé about this? 

330
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:23,429
Mrs. Donovan, I was kind enough to grant you this meeting. 

331
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:26,091
You were kind enough to prosecute 

332
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,233
and convict my son of a crime he didn’t commit. 

333
00:15:28,233 --> 00:15:29,482
I’m not going to entertain this. 

334
00:15:29,482 --> 00:15:30,279
All right

335
00:15:32,312 --> 00:15:33,985
Would you support me in my efforts 

336
00:15:33,985 --> 00:15:36,322
in trying to determine where the rape kit could have gone. 

337
00:15:36,322 --> 00:15:39,054
Of course, we are not trying to hide anything here. 

338
00:15:39,054 --> 00:15:39,597
Thank you. 

339
00:15:39,597 --> 00:15:41,385
But Ms. Frutt, lets be clear, 

340
00:15:41,385 --> 00:15:44,190
while I support your efforts to retrieve lost evidence 

341
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:47,725
I totally oppose the idea of this case being reopened. 

342
00:15:47,725 --> 00:15:50,265
Mr. Donovan was rightly convicted of a double homicide. 

343
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:52,825
He did not commit that crime!

344
00:15:52,825 --> 00:15:54,044
All right...

345
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,625
I appreciate you making the call. 

346
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,215
Mary, let's go.

347
00:16:04,617 --> 00:16:05,815
Look, Mary, here is the deal. 

348
00:16:05,815 --> 00:16:07,416
If we are going to make any progress on this, 

349
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:10,056
we are going to need a modicum of cooperation from the police 

350
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:12,627
and that is not going to happen with you antagonizing them. 

351
00:16:12,627 --> 00:16:15,146
That man is never going to help and I’ll tell you why. 

352
00:16:15,146 --> 00:16:17,787
His boss is running on a death penalty platform. 

353
00:16:17,787 --> 00:16:21,769
Stuart’s execution is the first one scheduled in a year. 

354
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:24,574
Politics-wise they need this to happen 

355
00:16:24,574 --> 00:16:27,804
They very well could have knowingly destroyed that rape kit. 

356
00:16:27,804 --> 00:16:29,287
And forgive my French, 

357
00:16:29,287 --> 00:16:32,944
but that man is an ass who is capable of concealing evidence. 

358
00:16:32,944 --> 00:16:36,276
Mary, I don’t want you to antagonize them. 

359
00:16:49,823 --> 00:16:50,901
How’s it going? 

360
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,873
That well. 

361
00:16:56,873 --> 00:16:58,854
He tried calling the woman’s doctors. 

362
00:16:58,854 --> 00:16:59,646
Why? 

363
00:17:00,571 --> 00:17:01,952
Good question. 

364
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:15,577
Since I’m second chair, 

365
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:19,163
I thought maybe you’d let me in on the strategy. 

366
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,205
That strategy is simple. 

367
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:24,888
Scott Simpson endured two years of watching his wife suffer. 

368
00:17:24,888 --> 00:17:27,644
What does that have to do with the doctors that treated her. 

369
00:17:27,644 --> 00:17:29,997
I was bringing them in to establish the suffering. 

370
00:17:29,997 --> 00:17:32,244
No, you weren’t, Bobby,

371
00:17:33,016 --> 00:17:35,393
you put Dr. Shields up their to attack him. 

372
00:17:36,876 --> 00:17:39,142
Helen isn’t the only one personalizing this. 

373
00:17:39,914 --> 00:17:41,417
What is going on with you? 

374
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:44,597
Lindsay, we have no defense, okay. 

375
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:47,488
I have to convey whatever Scott Simpson went through, 

376
00:17:47,488 --> 00:17:48,656
what his wife went through. 

377
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:50,696
It’s all about building up enough sympathy 

378
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:53,794
so that the jury feel compelled to ignore the law. 

379
00:17:53,794 --> 00:17:55,897
If that is what you were trying to do 

380
00:17:56,568 --> 00:17:58,792
then you went way off course. 

381
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:00,657
Look at me.

382
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:06,267
You were saying how the doctor’s weren’t there at the end. 

383
00:18:06,267 --> 00:18:08,550
Now, I know that 

384
00:18:09,484 --> 00:18:11,879
you had to turn the respirator off on your mother.

385
00:18:11,879 --> 00:18:14,277
It isn’t about that. 

386
00:18:14,277 --> 00:18:16,330
Why did it happen like that? 

387
00:18:18,006 --> 00:18:20,820
How was it that you had to turn it off? 

388
00:18:29,456 --> 00:18:31,721
The hospitals wouldn’t do it back then. 

389
00:18:34,221 --> 00:18:37,034
At least the hospital that she was in, 

390
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:43,943
it was a Catholic hospital. 

391
00:18:46,513 --> 00:18:49,408
And they just left the family alone with the patient. 

392
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:52,892
They showed us the button 

393
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,172
and the doctors, nurses

394
00:18:56,172 --> 00:18:57,088
they all left the room, 

395
00:18:57,088 --> 00:18:59,537
leaving just me and my dad with... 

396
00:19:01,051 --> 00:19:02,808
Why didn’t your dad do it? 

397
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,251
He couldn’t. 

398
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,177
My father couldn’t bring himself to hit that button, 

399
00:19:08,177 --> 00:19:10,118
even though he knew. 

400
00:19:12,338 --> 00:19:13,522
So, 

401
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,567
he asked me if I would do it,

402
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:26,644
while those doctors were outside comparing notes 

403
00:19:26,644 --> 00:19:30,870
on how well the patient tolerated this chemical versus that one, 

404
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:34,618
a fifteen year old kid was left inside 

405
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,099
to turn off his mother’s respirator...

406
00:19:47,249 --> 00:19:48,569
Now, you hate them. 

407
00:19:48,569 --> 00:19:52,653
Yeah, yeah I do. 

408
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:54,646
Okay, 

409
00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:00,326
but we have a murder trial here

410
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:07,078
and our client he needs you to try this case 

411
00:20:07,078 --> 00:20:08,890
and this case alone.

412
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:09,953
I’m doing that 

413
00:20:09,953 --> 00:20:13,580
No, you are not, Bobby. 

414
00:20:18,923 --> 00:20:20,366
Maybe, I should close. 

415
00:20:24,144 --> 00:20:25,394
I’ll close. 

416
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,024
Hey. 

417
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,778
Oh, Don’t you start. 

418
00:20:35,778 --> 00:20:37,080
Saying “hey’’ is starting? 

419
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,798
Well it depends. 

420
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:39,916
Have you come to pick out bridesmaid dresses? 

421
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,761
What, have you come to distract me from working on my closing? 

422
00:20:49,758 --> 00:20:52,833
Helen, this case can’t be a situation 

423
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,938
where your office is pressuring you to get a murder two. 

424
00:20:55,938 --> 00:20:57,952
Why not take the manslaughter? 

425
00:20:57,952 --> 00:20:59,086
I don’t know. 

426
00:20:59,086 --> 00:21:00,305
What do you mean ‘you don’t know? 

427
00:21:00,305 --> 00:21:01,488
That’s not really an answer. 

428
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:04,354
I don’t know. 

429
00:21:11,405 --> 00:21:13,286
This is where you keep the rape kits? 

430
00:21:13,286 --> 00:21:13,849
Yes, ma’am. 

431
00:21:13,849 --> 00:21:15,021
Some of the old ones. 

432
00:21:15,021 --> 00:21:16,832
Going back how far? 

433
00:21:16,832 --> 00:21:18,492
That I couldn’t tell you. 

434
00:21:20,536 --> 00:21:22,654
Donovan Stuart, 

435
00:21:23,557 --> 00:21:24,938
this should be it. 

436
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:32,453
It’s not in there. 

437
00:21:32,453 --> 00:21:33,911
Well, we figured it wouldn’t be in there. 

438
00:21:33,911 --> 00:21:35,396
That would have been a little too easy. 

439
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:38,181
So if it’s not here, 

440
00:21:38,181 --> 00:21:39,573
where else might it possibly be?

441
00:21:39,573 --> 00:21:41,073
How many different people handle these things? 

442
00:21:41,073 --> 00:21:42,186
This is just storage. 

443
00:21:42,186 --> 00:21:46,632
Chained up custody is all documented went to the lab in 92 

444
00:21:46,632 --> 00:21:49,284
and there is no documentation that it ever came back. 

445
00:21:49,284 --> 00:21:51,142
Well, could it still be at the lab? 

446
00:21:51,142 --> 00:21:52,854
They really don’t have storage capacity, 

447
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:54,486
plus we called and they say they don’t have it, 

448
00:21:54,486 --> 00:21:56,795
that means it is most likely destroyed 

449
00:21:56,795 --> 00:21:58,742
Where is this lab? 

450
00:21:58,742 --> 00:22:00,221
The address is on the paper 

451
00:22:01,426 --> 00:22:02,185
Ok.

452
00:22:02,403 --> 00:22:03,745
Thank you very much, officer. 

453
00:22:11,005 --> 00:22:14,303
It’s the hypocrisy of it all that gets me. 

454
00:22:15,986 --> 00:22:18,311
We are already helping patients die. 

455
00:22:18,311 --> 00:22:22,056
We make these morphine valium cocktails 

456
00:22:22,056 --> 00:22:26,732
and in the end it causes them to go into a coma and die. 

457
00:22:26,732 --> 00:22:29,826
Forget the crap about pain management 

458
00:22:29,826 --> 00:22:32,509
that is just a politically correct euphemism. 

459
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:37,097
It’s to hasten the patient’s death. 

460
00:22:37,097 --> 00:22:38,975
So, what are we talking about. 

461
00:22:38,975 --> 00:22:43,133
The so-called victim in this crime was going to die within 48 hours. 

462
00:22:43,133 --> 00:22:46,869
The so-called victim’s death was already being hastened medically 

463
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:50,294
and my client hastened it further 

464
00:22:50,294 --> 00:22:52,460
and he’s on trial for murder, 

465
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,783
that’s a joke. 

466
00:22:54,716 --> 00:22:58,078
We can’t give them a quick acting drug, 

467
00:22:58,078 --> 00:23:00,790
because that would seem to much like we are killing them, 

468
00:23:01,684 --> 00:23:03,215
so we give them a slow acting drug, 

469
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,836
let it take a day or so and we call it pain management. 

470
00:23:06,836 --> 00:23:08,044
That is a joke. 

471
00:23:08,044 --> 00:23:09,660
It would be funny, 

472
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,138
if it weren’t for the fact 

473
00:23:11,138 --> 00:23:16,502
that the patient often suffers excruciating agony in the meantime, 

474
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:21,284
which is exactly what was happening in this case. 

475
00:23:21,284 --> 00:23:23,241
Everybody in this room knows 

476
00:23:23,241 --> 00:23:28,857
if the doctor’s could have ended Sally Simpson’s pain quickly and mercifully, 

477
00:23:28,857 --> 00:23:33,686
Scott Simpson would have never picked up that gun. 

478
00:23:33,686 --> 00:23:35,650
But here we are 

479
00:23:36,629 --> 00:23:40,350
trying to take away his life,

480
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,897
trying to take him from his children, 

481
00:23:42,897 --> 00:23:46,270
trying to brand him a murderer. 

482
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,786
More than anything, 

483
00:23:49,786 --> 00:23:53,915
the law is suppose to protect the weakest members of our society. 

484
00:23:53,915 --> 00:23:57,680
The law wasn’t there in the end for Sally Simpson, 

485
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,352
the doctors weren’t there in the end 

486
00:24:01,112 --> 00:24:03,939
after they cut out half her insides, 

487
00:24:03,939 --> 00:24:05,019
pumping her full of drugs, 

488
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:06,217
prolonging her pain, 

489
00:24:06,217 --> 00:24:07,389
causing it, 

490
00:24:07,389 --> 00:24:08,897
they weren’t there in the end 

491
00:24:08,897 --> 00:24:09,802
only I...

492
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:14,528
only my client, Scott Simpson, 

493
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:20,126
only he was there in the end 

494
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:27,806
and he ended his wife’s suffering. 

495
00:24:31,032 --> 00:24:34,341
He didn’t stop a life, 

496
00:24:34,341 --> 00:24:37,025
he stopped pain 

497
00:24:40,477 --> 00:24:45,784
and they are asking you to call him a murderer. 

498
00:24:49,335 --> 00:24:52,526
First, there is a difference, ladies and gentlemen 

499
00:24:52,526 --> 00:24:56,494
between controlling pain with a dosage of medicine 

500
00:24:56,494 --> 00:25:00,719
that could forseeably cause death and simply killing someone. 

501
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:03,748
Maybe in the end it amounts to a small distinction, 

502
00:25:04,622 --> 00:25:05,610
but it is one. 

503
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:08,977
Doctors do not kill to kill. 

504
00:25:08,977 --> 00:25:12,090
Even if they did, as Mr. Donnell contends, 

505
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,758
it is still illegal. 

506
00:25:13,758 --> 00:25:17,909
Second, patient was already dying,

507
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:20,489
Mr. Simpson just hastened it further. 

508
00:25:21,526 --> 00:25:24,585
Please, where do we draw the line? 

509
00:25:24,585 --> 00:25:29,536
When do we say death is so close it becomes okay to kill? 

510
00:25:29,536 --> 00:25:35,320
Certainly if a prisoner on death row was murdered 

511
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,818
the day before his scheduled execution, 

512
00:25:37,818 --> 00:25:40,061
we would hold the killer accountable. 

513
00:25:40,858 --> 00:25:45,404
Third, Mrs. Simpson was suffering, 

514
00:25:47,207 --> 00:25:49,346
I certainly don’t dispute that, 

515
00:25:49,346 --> 00:25:54,423
but I definitely take issue with the suggestion 

516
00:25:54,423 --> 00:25:57,000
that when a person is in enough misery 

517
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,006
it becomes permissible to take out a gun and shoot her in the head. 

518
00:26:01,897 --> 00:26:03,403
Fourth, the law: 

519
00:26:03,403 --> 00:26:09,452
When a person intentionally takes the life of another human being 

520
00:26:09,452 --> 00:26:11,640
it’s murder. 

521
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,889
He can be loving, sympathetic, even heroic 

522
00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:19,255
if you are so inclined to find him that way, 

523
00:26:20,406 --> 00:26:23,002
but if he intentionally takes the life 

524
00:26:23,002 --> 00:26:25,998
of another human being acts in self defense, 

525
00:26:25,998 --> 00:26:27,918
or diminished mental capacity, 

526
00:26:27,918 --> 00:26:29,120
it is murder. 

527
00:26:30,031 --> 00:26:31,529
That is what we have here. 

528
00:26:32,652 --> 00:26:36,234
Now the arguments about the extenuating circumstances, 

529
00:26:36,234 --> 00:26:39,629
take that up at sentencing when it is time for leniency. 

530
00:26:39,629 --> 00:26:42,374
But here, the question is 

531
00:26:42,374 --> 00:26:44,320
did he commit a crime. 

532
00:26:44,975 --> 00:26:47,870
I suppose you can choose to ignore your duty. 

533
00:26:48,967 --> 00:26:52,014
You can do here exactly what Mr. Simpson did 

534
00:26:52,014 --> 00:26:54,790
and take the law into your hands. 

535
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,951
Would I understand, yes. 

536
00:26:56,951 --> 00:26:58,920
Would it make you popular in the public’s eye, 

537
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,656
I bet it would. 

538
00:26:59,656 --> 00:27:01,201
Would it make you right? 

539
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,151
You know the answer to that.

540
00:27:13,392 --> 00:27:15,676
This isn’t a forum for policy, 

541
00:27:16,671 --> 00:27:22,095
but since Mr. Donnell argued it, I agree. 

542
00:27:22,095 --> 00:27:27,738
The law is designed to protect its weakest member, 

543
00:27:27,738 --> 00:27:32,080
that would include the sick, the aged, the dying. 

544
00:27:32,972 --> 00:27:35,849
Just consider the potential for abuse 

545
00:27:35,849 --> 00:27:39,746
if we let ourselves become open to the idea 

546
00:27:41,189 --> 00:27:46,883
that sometimes its okay to take out a gun and put somebody down.  

547
00:27:57,403 --> 00:27:59,159
Your honor, chambers. 

548
00:28:00,874 --> 00:28:01,731
What’s up? 

549
00:28:01,731 --> 00:28:05,228
I want you to instruct the jury that a conviction means a life sentence. 

550
00:28:05,228 --> 00:28:05,509
What? 

551
00:28:05,509 --> 00:28:07,199
She argued sentencing in her closing. 

552
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:07,704
I did not 

553
00:28:07,704 --> 00:28:08,665
You said leniency. 

554
00:28:08,665 --> 00:28:10,742
That implied to the jury that you could be lenient, 

555
00:28:10,742 --> 00:28:11,617
when that is not the case. 

556
00:28:11,617 --> 00:28:13,317
A conviction on murder two means life. 

557
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:14,477
What do you want me to do? 

558
00:28:14,477 --> 00:28:16,419
Tell them that. He would be looking at life. 

559
00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:17,314
Forget it. 

560
00:28:17,314 --> 00:28:19,136
You have no discretion to be lenient 

561
00:28:19,136 --> 00:28:20,641
and right now the jury thinks you do. 

562
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:21,999
I think you are overreacting. 

563
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:23,157
She knew what she was doing. 

564
00:28:23,157 --> 00:28:24,280
Don’t be accusing me. 

565
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,720
It bordered on prosecutorial misconduct! 

566
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,941
Hey, I stuck to the law. You argued jury nullification. 

567
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:31,363
You cannot let that jury deliberate under the false impression 

568
00:28:31,363 --> 00:28:33,064
that my client might get a lighter sentence. 

569
00:28:33,064 --> 00:28:35,127
There will be no further talk on sentencing. 

570
00:28:35,127 --> 00:28:37,070
I’m certainly not going to give instruction on it. 

571
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,619
It was a deliberate act of deception! 

572
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:40,132
It was not. How could you... 

573
00:28:40,132 --> 00:28:40,937
You’re a liar! 

574
00:28:40,937 --> 00:28:41,565
Hey! 

575
00:28:41,565 --> 00:28:42,357
Helen! 

576
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,243
I’ll hold you both in contempt! 

577
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:50,363
You want to fight the fight in the courtroom, fine. 

578
00:28:50,363 --> 00:28:52,943
I will not accept that kind of personal attack. 

579
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,544
You were totally out of line. 

580
00:29:07,544 --> 00:29:09,728
She said leniency, you heard it! 

581
00:29:09,728 --> 00:29:11,404
I’m talking about calling her a liar. 

582
00:29:12,206 --> 00:29:14,555
Bobby, the law is totally on Helen’s side here. 

583
00:29:14,555 --> 00:29:15,762
Whose kidding who? 

584
00:29:15,762 --> 00:29:17,532
Yes, she could have gone manslaughter, 

585
00:29:17,532 --> 00:29:18,761
which I think she should have.

586
00:29:18,761 --> 00:29:20,740
but the facts easily support murder two. 

587
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,295
So, I would be a murderer then. 

588
00:29:23,005 --> 00:29:24,296
Is that what you are saying? 

589
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:25,657
Of course I’m not saying that. 

590
00:29:27,801 --> 00:29:29,700
Is that what is going on here, 

591
00:29:31,589 --> 00:29:33,002
you’re defending yourself? 

592
00:29:36,832 --> 00:29:38,556
My God, 

593
00:29:40,832 --> 00:29:43,148
have you been carrying that around?

594
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:45,129
You killed your mother? 

595
00:29:45,129 --> 00:29:46,364
I don’t think that. You said it. 

596
00:29:46,364 --> 00:29:48,163
I didn’t say it. It came out of you. 

597
00:29:49,927 --> 00:29:50,760
Bobby? 

598
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:55,713
Bobby? 

599
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:04,655
Look, I understand your problem, 

600
00:30:04,655 --> 00:30:06,880
but we send all samples back to the evidence locker. 

601
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,919
There is very limited storage capacity here. 

602
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:10,121
We don’t hang on to rape kits. 

603
00:30:10,121 --> 00:30:13,109
But the police don’t have any records of you returning the rape kit on Donovan. 

604
00:30:13,109 --> 00:30:14,868
Well, we have a record of sending it back to them 

605
00:30:14,868 --> 00:30:15,533
I could show it to you, 

606
00:30:15,533 --> 00:30:15,997
it’s right here. 

607
00:30:15,997 --> 00:30:17,269
Well, if you wrote it down. 

608
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:20,204
Can you tell me who you used as a messenger service? 

609
00:30:20,204 --> 00:30:23,068
We don’t use services it presents chain of custody problems. 

610
00:30:23,068 --> 00:30:25,649
So people here would’ve delivered it directly to the police? 

611
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:26,279
Yes. 

612
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:28,768
So basically you are saying it got lost there; 

613
00:30:28,768 --> 00:30:30,411
they are saying it got lost here. 

614
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,708
Well, if I were a betting man I’d say it got lost there. 

615
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:37,997
Okay, does Jack Semler still work here? 

616
00:30:37,997 --> 00:30:38,840
Who? 

617
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,092
Jack Semler, he was the technician who did the testing back in 92. 

618
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:43,179
Can I see your paperwork? 

619
00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:43,921
Yeah, sure. 

620
00:30:46,506 --> 00:30:48,050
Yeah, there’s been a mistake here. 

621
00:30:48,376 --> 00:30:49,793
What kind of mistake? 

622
00:30:49,793 --> 00:30:51,175
We didn’t do this testing. 

623
00:30:51,175 --> 00:30:51,957
What? 

624
00:30:51,957 --> 00:30:53,684
Jack Semler works for a private lab 

625
00:30:53,684 --> 00:30:55,696
we sometimes hire out when we are swamped here. 

626
00:30:55,696 --> 00:30:57,866
I think our records, 

627
00:30:57,866 --> 00:31:00,101
they indicate that we sent it back to the police 

628
00:31:00,101 --> 00:31:02,489
when we may have sent it to Kendall laboratories. 

629
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:07,086
well, if we have it, this is the only place it could be 

630
00:31:07,086 --> 00:31:08,712
How long do you keep samples for? 

631
00:31:08,712 --> 00:31:10,093
It varies.

632
00:31:10,093 --> 00:31:13,655
let’s see...Donovan, Donavan, Donavan 

633
00:31:13,655 --> 00:31:14,457
First name? 

634
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:15,412
Stuart. 

635
00:31:15,412 --> 00:31:16,907
1992? 

636
00:31:16,907 --> 00:31:17,639
Yes. 

637
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,174
Nope, nothing. 

638
00:31:23,551 --> 00:31:26,562
Well, if you don’t have it and it didn’t make its way back to the police, 

639
00:31:26,562 --> 00:31:28,217
do you have any idea where it could be? 

640
00:31:28,217 --> 00:31:29,590
Sorry. 

641
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:33,368
Unless, what was the victim’s name?

642
00:31:33,368 --> 00:31:34,357
Kearns. 

643
00:31:34,357 --> 00:31:37,099
Sometimes they screw up and store it under the victim’s name.

644
00:31:37,099 --> 00:31:38,867
Let’s see, Kearns 

645
00:31:38,867 --> 00:31:40,738
John, no, 

646
00:31:40,738 --> 00:31:42,829
Steven, Alyssa? 

647
00:31:42,829 --> 00:31:44,007
Yes. that's it, Alyssa.

648
00:31:44,007 --> 00:31:45,139
32665? 

649
00:31:45,139 --> 00:31:46,429
Yes, that is the file number. 

650
00:31:47,634 --> 00:31:48,202
Huh. 

651
00:31:48,771 --> 00:31:50,691
What do you mean huh? 

652
00:31:51,362 --> 00:31:52,235
We have it. 

653
00:31:52,235 --> 00:31:53,678
You have it? 

654
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:54,633
Here it is. 

655
00:32:03,451 --> 00:32:04,569
Is she still there? 

656
00:32:04,569 --> 00:32:06,267
They tracked down the rape kit. 

657
00:32:06,267 --> 00:32:07,558
She still in Philadelphia? 

658
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:10,371
She’s meeting with the DA asking for another DNA test. 

659
00:32:10,371 --> 00:32:12,474
What if this one is conclusive? Did she think about that? 

660
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:14,963
What’s to lose. He’s due to be executed in five weeks. 

661
00:32:15,596 --> 00:32:17,120
We’re getting paid for this? 

662
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,156
$500 cash. 

663
00:32:18,156 --> 00:32:19,822
Hey, now we should expand. 

664
00:32:20,627 --> 00:32:22,009
What’s up with your case? 

665
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:23,883
The jury is still out. 

666
00:32:24,675 --> 00:32:26,161
Anybody seen Lindsay?

667
00:32:38,188 --> 00:32:40,027
Lindsay, hey. 

668
00:32:40,027 --> 00:32:40,962
Hi. 

669
00:32:45,076 --> 00:32:46,813
You know, you are in a men’s room. 

670
00:32:46,813 --> 00:32:49,718
Well, I hear unisex is the new rage. 

671
00:32:50,653 --> 00:32:52,014
How is Bobby? 

672
00:32:53,618 --> 00:32:59,024
Well, he’s a little unsettled at the moment. 

673
00:32:59,024 --> 00:33:00,232
Something wrong? 

674
00:33:00,232 --> 00:33:01,895
You two aren’t fighting, are you? 

675
00:33:01,895 --> 00:33:03,866
No, no, we are not fighting. 

676
00:33:06,457 --> 00:33:08,478
He think he killed his mother. 

677
00:33:13,832 --> 00:33:16,118
You two really need to talk more. 

678
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,036
It’s not something...

679
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:27,696
It’s not something I can talk about. 

680
00:33:32,714 --> 00:33:35,315
Well, your son needs to. 

681
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,304
I’m afraid I can’t agree 

682
00:33:42,304 --> 00:33:45,039
You can’t agree to a DNA test? 

683
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:45,658
No, 

684
00:33:45,658 --> 00:33:46,668
Why? 

685
00:33:46,668 --> 00:33:48,547
Ms. Frutt, this case is over. 

686
00:33:48,547 --> 00:33:50,265
It’s been over for 12 years. 

687
00:33:50,265 --> 00:33:51,870
He’s about to be put to death 

688
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:54,386
Are you saying that we should go back and reopen an investigation 

689
00:33:54,386 --> 00:33:56,794
simply because a sentence is about to be carried out? 

690
00:33:56,794 --> 00:33:57,809
You bastard! 

691
00:33:57,809 --> 00:33:58,878
Mary! 

692
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:02,429
The DNA technology has improved

693
00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:04,552
it is possible that a new test can exonerate...

694
00:34:04,552 --> 00:34:06,695
I couldn’t reopen if I wanted to 

695
00:34:06,695 --> 00:34:08,774
This is new evidence , of course you can. 

696
00:34:08,774 --> 00:34:12,035
It isn’t new evidence, we had the rape kit at trial. 

697
00:34:12,035 --> 00:34:14,618
Look, I understand there might be political gain 

698
00:34:14,618 --> 00:34:16,197
in seeing this execution through. 

699
00:34:16,197 --> 00:34:19,051
It isn’t that and I’m offended at the accusation 

700
00:34:19,051 --> 00:34:20,605
You are offended at the accusation? 

701
00:34:20,605 --> 00:34:22,522
How about, I might have an innocent kid...

702
00:34:22,522 --> 00:34:23,211
He isn’t 

703
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:24,264
set to be put to death 

704
00:34:24,264 --> 00:34:25,914
and all we are asking is for a simple test 

705
00:34:25,914 --> 00:34:27,794
to confirm that you got the right guy. 

706
00:34:27,794 --> 00:34:29,359
It isn’t that simple. 

707
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,606
You are in here asking that we reopen an investigation . 

708
00:34:33,606 --> 00:34:35,064
If we did that for you, 

709
00:34:35,064 --> 00:34:38,026
every defense attorney in town would be lining up 

710
00:34:38,026 --> 00:34:40,251
outside my office asking for the very same thing...

711
00:34:40,251 --> 00:34:43,898
I’m the only defense attorney with a client slated for execution. 

712
00:34:43,898 --> 00:34:45,228
The answer is no. 

713
00:34:46,621 --> 00:34:47,800
Then we will go to court. 

714
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,841
Do what you think you must. 

715
00:34:55,948 --> 00:34:59,656
The jury has asked whether they can come back with manslaughter 

716
00:34:59,656 --> 00:35:01,291
What did you say? 

717
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,153
I told them no. 

718
00:35:06,952 --> 00:35:10,416
It’s murder one, murder two, 

719
00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:12,255
or straight acquittal. 

720
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,913
It’s poker time folks. 

721
00:35:19,354 --> 00:35:22,422
Obviously they don’t want to convict on murder two, 

722
00:35:24,301 --> 00:35:27,185
but they might be more reluctant to set him free. 

723
00:35:29,421 --> 00:35:31,219
Who is going to blink? 

724
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:35,668
I’m still willing to take manslaughter. 

725
00:35:43,135 --> 00:35:44,659
No. 

726
00:35:45,087 --> 00:35:46,265
Helen. 

727
00:35:47,852 --> 00:35:48,878
No. 

728
00:35:54,105 --> 00:35:54,837
Helen 

729
00:35:55,588 --> 00:35:57,315
You are grabbing me again. 

730
00:35:57,315 --> 00:35:59,692
Sorry, I called you a liar 

731
00:36:00,718 --> 00:36:02,136
Okay 

732
00:36:03,274 --> 00:36:04,808
You don’t think we can deal this? 

733
00:36:04,808 --> 00:36:07,943
You know, Eleanor has been asking why I push this, 

734
00:36:07,943 --> 00:36:09,050
Lindsay asked, 

735
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,737
truth is I don’t know. 

736
00:36:10,737 --> 00:36:12,301
I’ve been asking myself . 

737
00:36:13,348 --> 00:36:14,942
What is the answer? 

738
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:22,547
We live in a country where people kill each other a lot, 

739
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:23,553
mostly with guns 

740
00:36:23,553 --> 00:36:26,313
and whether I feel for your client or not, 

741
00:36:26,313 --> 00:36:27,298
and I do, 

742
00:36:28,964 --> 00:36:33,772
the thought of expanding the boundaries, even microscopically, 

743
00:36:33,772 --> 00:36:36,281
where it becomes excusable to shoot somebody, 

744
00:36:37,144 --> 00:36:38,649
I can’t do it. 

745
00:36:38,649 --> 00:36:40,274
It has to stay repugnant, 

746
00:36:40,274 --> 00:36:43,759
excusable is too short of a leap to acceptable. 

747
00:36:46,299 --> 00:36:47,843
I can’t do it. 

748
00:36:57,412 --> 00:36:59,883
All we are asking to do is a simple DNA test 

749
00:36:59,883 --> 00:37:04,047
to confirm whether Stuart Donovan, was in fact the man who raped Alyssa Kearns. 

750
00:37:04,047 --> 00:37:06,647
My understanding is we had a match. 

751
00:37:06,647 --> 00:37:09,451
A blood type match, but that is hardly conclusive. 

752
00:37:09,451 --> 00:37:12,637
We also had an eyewitness , plus his finger prints. 

753
00:37:12,637 --> 00:37:14,150
This isn’t about that. 

754
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:18,650
Young lady, I was the trial judge in this case . 

755
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:22,608
If you are suggesting that Mr. Donovan didn’t get a fair trial...

756
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:23,828
That is not my suggestion, 

757
00:37:23,828 --> 00:37:28,347
to repeat I’m only asking that you authorize a DNA test. 

758
00:37:29,927 --> 00:37:30,953
Mr. Platt. 

759
00:37:30,953 --> 00:37:32,685
Under Pennsylvania law, 

760
00:37:32,685 --> 00:37:36,393
new evidence must be introduced within 60 days of its discovery. 

761
00:37:36,393 --> 00:37:38,776
The rape kit is 12 years old. 

762
00:37:38,776 --> 00:37:41,529
Defense had opportunity to analyze it before trial. 

763
00:37:41,529 --> 00:37:43,105
Technology is different. 

764
00:37:43,105 --> 00:37:45,153
The new evidence is not the rape kit, 

765
00:37:45,153 --> 00:37:47,104
it wold be the results of the testing. 

766
00:37:47,104 --> 00:37:50,451
So the 60 day statute of limitations has not even begun to toll. 

767
00:37:50,451 --> 00:37:53,519
Analysis of evidence is not new evidence 

768
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:55,281
This is suppose to be about the truth. 

769
00:37:55,281 --> 00:37:58,025
One lousy test brings us to the truth. 

770
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:01,804
A judicial system is a process, Ms. Frutt. 

771
00:38:01,804 --> 00:38:04,394
We have rules of procedures, 

772
00:38:04,394 --> 00:38:06,609
new evidence is one thing, 

773
00:38:06,609 --> 00:38:11,181
but three evaluations of all evidence is quite another. 

774
00:38:11,181 --> 00:38:11,827
Your honor 

775
00:38:11,827 --> 00:38:13,178
The petition is denied. 

776
00:38:13,178 --> 00:38:16,175
He is facing a death penalty. 

777
00:38:16,893 --> 00:38:18,235
We are adjourned. 

778
00:38:30,562 --> 00:38:31,760
Where’s my mother 

779
00:38:33,366 --> 00:38:34,981
She um....

780
00:38:34,981 --> 00:38:37,277
She’s going to come by a little later.

781
00:38:37,277 --> 00:38:39,481
She’s some place crying, huh? 

782
00:38:40,446 --> 00:38:43,057
No, she’s upset, Stuart. 

783
00:38:43,057 --> 00:38:46,572
She just doesn’t know when to quit, that’s all. 

784
00:38:49,157 --> 00:38:51,818
Well, I guess she and I have something in common then, 

785
00:38:51,818 --> 00:38:53,404
because I’m not quitting. 

786
00:38:53,404 --> 00:38:54,948
What are you going to do? 

787
00:38:57,589 --> 00:39:00,885
I don’t know, but I’m not going to go back to Boston. 

788
00:39:00,885 --> 00:39:02,277
I can tell you that. 

789
00:39:18,061 --> 00:39:20,957
Mr. Foreman, the jury has reached its verdict? 

790
00:39:20,957 --> 00:39:22,308
We have. 

791
00:39:22,308 --> 00:39:24,716
Defendant, please rise . 

792
00:39:28,962 --> 00:39:30,211
What say you?

793
00:39:31,725 --> 00:39:34,762
On Commonwealth versus Scott Simpson, 

794
00:39:34,762 --> 00:39:37,637
on the charge of murder in the first degree, 

795
00:39:37,637 --> 00:39:40,492
we find the defendant Scott Simpson 

796
00:39:41,203 --> 00:39:42,351
not guilty. 

797
00:39:44,017 --> 00:39:47,115
On the charge of murder in the second degree, 

798
00:39:47,115 --> 00:39:50,010
we find the defendant Scott Simpson 

799
00:39:51,316 --> 00:39:52,474
guilty. 

800
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:57,794
Members of the jury, this completes your service, 

801
00:39:57,794 --> 00:39:59,094
the court thanks you. 

802
00:40:00,436 --> 00:40:01,586
This matter is adjourned. 

803
00:40:01,586 --> 00:40:04,157
Security will take the defendant into custody. 

804
00:40:21,387 --> 00:40:23,916
Aunt Lori is going to take you guys home 

805
00:40:23,916 --> 00:40:28,153
and you will stay with her for a little while like we talked about. 

806
00:40:28,153 --> 00:40:30,702
Everything is going to be okay. 

807
00:40:30,702 --> 00:40:32,297
They’ll be okay, Scott. 

808
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:34,461
I’ll call you tomorrow guys, okay? 

809
00:40:34,461 --> 00:40:37,275
Goodnight, dad. I love you. 

810
00:40:41,664 --> 00:40:44,834
I’ll go with the boys, I’ll take them home. 

811
00:40:46,175 --> 00:40:47,465
Okay. 

812
00:40:48,441 --> 00:40:49,915
Are you okay? 

813
00:40:51,936 --> 00:40:53,165
Yeah.
