1
00:00:03,841 --> 00:00:05,437
They turned it down.  

2
00:00:06,023 --> 00:00:07,580
So now what?

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,152
We either try it, or we up the offer. 

4
00:00:10,152 --> 00:00:13,725
I think we could make it go away for 175,000.  

5
00:00:13,725 --> 00:00:15,622
175,000 would break me. 

6
00:00:17,363 --> 00:00:18,659
I got no coverage for this, Jimmy.

7
00:00:18,659 --> 00:00:19,525
I know.  

8
00:00:20,335 --> 00:00:21,464
If we go to trial…

9
00:00:21,464 --> 00:00:24,660
Jury's already sworen in, it would be 2 or 3 days. 

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,642
It’ll only cost you my time which...  

11
00:00:26,642 --> 00:00:29,538
I don’t mean the cost of the trial. 

12
00:00:29,538 --> 00:00:32,870
I am asking would we win.

13
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,887
I don’t know, Peter. 

14
00:00:35,544 --> 00:00:40,077
Legally, what you did was invasion of privacy.  

15
00:00:40,077 --> 00:00:41,497
He has a deadly disease…

16
00:00:41,497 --> 00:00:43,240
And we will certainly argue that. 

17
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,994
I’m just telling you I’m not sure we’ll win.  

18
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:53,987
Let’s go to trial.

19
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:57,096
I ain’t taking murder 2. 

20
00:00:57,096 --> 00:00:58,149
Why should I take that? 

21
00:00:58,149 --> 00:00:59,502
That’s life. Murder 2.

22
00:00:59,502 --> 00:01:01,148
Why should I take that? That’s life.  

23
00:01:01,148 --> 00:01:04,154
I am not necessarily recommending it, Alex. 

24
00:01:04,154 --> 00:01:06,900
I’m just making you aware of the state’s offer.

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,551
Plus, with murder 2, there is some possibility of parole. 

26
00:01:10,551 --> 00:01:11,193
Murder 1…  

27
00:01:11,193 --> 00:01:12,358
They will kill me in prison. 

28
00:01:12,358 --> 00:01:13,781
I know what happens to people like me. 

29
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:15,002
They will kill me. I know what happens. 

30
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:16,975
You have to beat this, Mr. Young.

31
00:01:17,601 --> 00:01:20,954
Well, I don’t think I will. 

32
00:01:20,954 --> 00:01:22,226
The woman you killed…  

33
00:01:22,226 --> 00:01:23,420
I didn’t! 

34
00:01:24,058 --> 00:01:25,705
Allegedly killed. 

35
00:01:25,705 --> 00:01:27,741
She was the daughter of a college chancellor. 

36
00:01:27,741 --> 00:01:29,083
She has got a lot of publicity. 

37
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:32,393
And they don’t assign Helen Gamble cases for her charm.  

38
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:35,025
You have to take care of this. I did’t do it. 

39
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:37,588
You have to make them see that. I didn’t do it!

40
00:01:37,588 --> 00:01:40,378
Even so, you have to realize how it looks. 

41
00:01:40,378 --> 00:01:42,034
The police discovered you having sex with her.  

42
00:01:42,034 --> 00:01:43,273
But she was already dead.

43
00:01:43,273 --> 00:01:45,058
How many times did I have to say it?

44
00:01:45,058 --> 00:01:48,446
So you just found a dead woman in the dumpster, 

45
00:01:48,446 --> 00:01:50,885
and decided to have sex with her?  

46
00:01:50,885 --> 00:01:52,317
Yes. 

47
00:01:52,317 --> 00:01:54,582
And you have to make them see that. 

48
00:01:55,443 --> 00:01:57,756
I ain’t going down for murder 2.

49
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:01,738
All right. 

50
00:02:01,738 --> 00:02:05,996
Look, uh, we are gonna have some clothes sent over for you to wear at trial.  

51
00:02:05,996 --> 00:02:07,615
We are gonna need you to take a shower.

52
00:02:07,615 --> 00:02:08,779
why?  

53
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,506
Because you stink, Mr. Dickson.

54
00:02:12,506 --> 00:02:16,962
You think I’m some kind of animal. That’s what you think. 

55
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,166
I am a human being.

56
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:27,385
听写：夕・夏

57
00:02:28,406 --> 00:02:32,214
时间轴：美溪客

58
00:03:07,411 --> 00:03:08,976
Why not go insanity? 

59
00:03:08,976 --> 00:03:10,605
I don’t think he is insane. 

60
00:03:10,605 --> 00:03:12,214
Plus, he insists he didn’t kill her.

61
00:03:12,214 --> 00:03:13,949
I assume Helen has got her fangs out.

62
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:15,320
Oh you have no idea.

63
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,336
Can I ask does Lindsay really need to be on this?

64
00:03:18,336 --> 00:03:22,796
Is that a strategic question or more you don’t want her sit next to the guy?

65
00:03:22,796 --> 00:03:24,399
Probably the latter, I admit.

66
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:24,931
I’m OK.

67
00:03:24,931 --> 00:03:27,010
It’s a court appointment. We have to give him a defense.

68
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,504
We certainly don’t have to provide two attorneys. 

69
00:03:29,504 --> 00:03:32,087
I think having a woman at the table helps.

70
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,398
A radio station gave out our number. 

71
00:03:34,398 --> 00:03:37,524
Some DJ’s telling his listeners to call us and tell us we are scum. 

72
00:03:37,524 --> 00:03:38,298
Great.

73
00:03:38,298 --> 00:03:39,455
We already knew that.

74
00:03:39,455 --> 00:03:41,271
I’m gonna shut down the phones for the morning. 

75
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:43,383
So let's everybody take their cellulars.

76
00:03:43,383 --> 00:03:44,971
Jimmy, how are you doing?

77
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:47,628
We have offered 125.000. He turned us down. 

78
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:48,767
Trial starts today.

79
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:49,807
I’d go higher.

80
00:03:49,807 --> 00:03:50,734
Don’t start.

81
00:03:50,734 --> 00:03:52,060
He revealed the guy’s medical condition.

82
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,784
He didn’t fire the guy. He quit. 

83
00:03:53,784 --> 00:03:56,222
After your client set down a memo telling the whole world.

84
00:03:56,222 --> 00:03:58,189
This guy has AIDS, Rebecca. His coworkers…

85
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:00,056
He also has a right to privacy.

86
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:01,358
And they have the right to be safe.

87
00:04:01,358 --> 00:04:02,929
All right, enough for the arguing. 

88
00:04:02,929 --> 00:04:06,649
125,000 is a line in the sand. We start trial today. 

89
00:04:06,649 --> 00:04:11,152
And P.S., I’ve known Peter Hines since high school. 

90
00:04:11,152 --> 00:04:13,032
He is not a bigot.

91
00:04:13,032 --> 00:04:14,508
All right. Any second chair?

92
00:04:14,508 --> 00:04:16,816
Thanks. I’ll pass on the chairs here.

93
00:04:16,816 --> 00:04:17,976
-You’re personalizing.  -Let’s go!

94
00:04:17,976 --> 00:04:20,115
Cellulars. Scum today, you guys.

95
00:04:24,626 --> 00:04:27,623
How did Mr. Hines even find out you had AIDS?

96
00:04:27,623 --> 00:04:30,020
We were required to take physicals for our insurance. 

97
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,740
He owns the company, somewhere found out I was first diagnosed 3 years ago.

98
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,994
But he didn't tell the other employees at Straub until last year?

99
00:04:36,994 --> 00:04:40,171
Yes, he suddenly decided to circulate an in-office memo 

100
00:04:40,171 --> 00:04:42,849
to all employees which totally about 90.

101
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,754
Did he give you an explanation as to why he did this?

102
00:04:45,754 --> 00:04:47,557
Yes. Concern for their health.

103
00:04:47,557 --> 00:04:52,190
And what happened, Mr. Mayfield, after this memo was circulated?

104
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,069
I began to be treated differently. 

105
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:56,264
Some people act like they had to play. 

106
00:04:56,264 --> 00:04:58,988
Others, they were wordly hostile. 

107
00:04:58,988 --> 00:05:01,933
And I was no longer welcomed to play in our basketball team. 

108
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:03,574
We had an inner office accountant league. 

109
00:05:03,574 --> 00:05:08,692
And I was invited to stay at home by our team captain. 

110
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:11,466
So basicly you began to be discriminated against?

111
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:14,225
Yes. I wasn't totally ostracized, though. 

112
00:05:14,225 --> 00:05:17,021
There are some people in the firm with whom I have made friends. 

113
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:21,325
There is even some people who assault me with their sympathy. 

114
00:05:21,325 --> 00:05:24,727
They offered me the names of various support groups...

115
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:27,809
um, I think they are the worst. 

116
00:05:27,809 --> 00:05:30,123
I mean there is nothing more oppressive 

117
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:32,423
than a well-meaning sympathize on the lose. 

118
00:05:32,423 --> 00:05:36,867
Mr. Mayfield. How was it no longer tolerable to work there?

119
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:41,209
Well, I went from being an accountant in good standing, 

120
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:44,686
one who enjoyed comradery with my coworkers, 

121
00:05:44,686 --> 00:05:47,626
to being the one with AIDS, 

122
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:50,849
the sick one.

123
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:55,606
But you are the sick one, aren't you, Mr. Mayfield?

124
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,571
I don't prefer to see myself that way.

125
00:05:57,571 --> 00:06:00,081
But you have a fatal disease, don't you?   

126
00:06:00,698 --> 00:06:02,130
Yes.

127
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,557
And this disease is infectious, isn't it?

128
00:06:04,557 --> 00:06:06,592
Through sexual intercourse and needle use, 

129
00:06:06,592 --> 00:06:08,237
but not casual office contact. 

130
00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:11,963
Well, the spread is not limited to sex and needle use. 

131
00:06:11,963 --> 00:06:13,601
That isn't true, is it, Mr. Mayfield?

132
00:06:13,601 --> 00:06:15,394
Those are the most common ways it spreads. 

133
00:06:15,394 --> 00:06:18,907
It could spread from kissing, if there were open mouth source.

134
00:06:18,907 --> 00:06:21,190
I wasn't going around kissing. 

135
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,031
Or if people had cuts on their hands.

136
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:25,282
I never went to work with cuts on my hands, I ...

137
00:06:25,282 --> 00:06:28,486
But what if you accidentally did cut yourself? 

138
00:06:28,486 --> 00:06:31,801
What if you took an elbow playing basketball, got a nose bleed.

139
00:06:31,801 --> 00:06:34,204
The risks you are talking about are so minimal that...

140
00:06:34,204 --> 00:06:38,998
But does that mean it's your right to assume them on behalf of everybody else? 

141
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:42,376
A fatal disease which is infectious, 

142
00:06:42,376 --> 00:06:45,232
shouldn't it be a person's right to choose 

143
00:06:45,232 --> 00:06:48,482
whether he plays in a sport with physical contact with you? 

144
00:06:49,406 --> 00:06:51,372
If I had a cut on my hand, 

145
00:06:51,372 --> 00:06:55,990
I probably like to know which of my colleagues at work have AIDS.

146
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,715
Does that make my crazy?

147
00:06:57,715 --> 00:07:01,858
The problem, Mr. Berluti, is there are prejudices and bigotries 

148
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:05,448
that go beyond health issues when it comes to people with AIDS. 

149
00:07:05,448 --> 00:07:08,606
My client didn't fire you, did he?   

150
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:10,616
No.

151
00:07:13,723 --> 00:07:15,695
Mr. Young. Mr. Young, ....

152
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,110
Excuse us, no occasion.

153
00:07:23,813 --> 00:07:25,633
Her name was Hilary Brandon. 

154
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:29,223
She was a second year copywriter at Rogers&Cole. 

155
00:07:29,223 --> 00:07:32,633
She worked downtown and would like to walk home after work 

156
00:07:32,633 --> 00:07:35,051
to her town house in the south end. 

157
00:07:35,051 --> 00:07:37,864
Friends describe her in many wonderful ways. 

158
00:07:37,864 --> 00:07:41,541
But generous and charitable are two words 

159
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,425
that had become almost synonymous with her name. 

160
00:07:44,425 --> 00:07:49,203
She would never pass a homeless person without offering something. 

161
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:51,642
That was said by her roommate. 

162
00:07:51,642 --> 00:07:55,323
Well, she should have passed this one, ladies and gentlemen.

163
00:07:55,323 --> 00:08:01,260
The evidence will show that Alex Dickson raped and strangled Hilary Brandon,

164
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,379
strangled her to death. 

165
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:08,520
The evidence will show that this man continued to rape her 

166
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,609
after she was dead. 

167
00:08:10,609 --> 00:08:15,269
He was still on top of her lifeless body raping the corpse 

168
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:18,542
when Officer Mark Fryerson discovered him. 

169
00:08:21,097 --> 00:08:23,206
This is...

170
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:27,404
This is the ugly part of criminal law. 

171
00:08:27,404 --> 00:08:30,094
We deal with crimes that... 

172
00:08:32,807 --> 00:08:34,895
Fortunately, 

173
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:39,746
at least this one is simple.

174
00:08:39,746 --> 00:08:44,127
I won't have to take up too much of your time with the ugliness. 

175
00:08:49,725 --> 00:08:54,112
The ugly part of criminal law is when you convict the wrong person. 

176
00:08:54,112 --> 00:08:57,889
Alex Dickson had sex with Hilary Brandon's lifeless body, 

177
00:08:57,889 --> 00:08:59,212
but he didn't kill her. 

178
00:08:59,212 --> 00:09:02,511
You are certainly entitled to be disgusted by this man, 

179
00:09:02,511 --> 00:09:06,524
but you can't convict him of murder unless the evidence supports that finding, 

180
00:09:06,524 --> 00:09:08,023
and it won't, 

181
00:09:08,854 --> 00:09:11,704
because somebody else killed Hilary Brandon. 

182
00:09:11,704 --> 00:09:13,866
It wasn't Alex Dickson.

183
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:20,223
How long after you got the call did you find him?

184
00:09:20,223 --> 00:09:22,364
About an hour, maybe a little less. 

185
00:09:22,364 --> 00:09:24,650
There is a back alley behind Washington. 

186
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:25,638
It is in it. 

187
00:09:25,638 --> 00:09:27,150
I decided to go and check it.

188
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,587
And what did you find?

189
00:09:28,587 --> 00:09:31,368
I heard some activity over behind a large dumpster.

190
00:09:32,227 --> 00:09:35,842
I headed that way, shined my light, 

191
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:37,139
there he was.

192
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:38,597
There who was?   

193
00:09:39,282 --> 00:09:41,964
Him. The defendant. 

194
00:09:41,964 --> 00:09:43,797
Could you see what he was doing?

195
00:09:46,657 --> 00:09:49,733
He was engaging sexual intercourse with a nude female body. 

196
00:09:50,438 --> 00:09:51,761
I ordered him to get off the woman, 

197
00:09:51,761 --> 00:09:53,219
lie on the ground, face down, 

198
00:09:53,219 --> 00:09:55,308
at which point I handcuffed him. 

199
00:09:55,308 --> 00:09:57,255
I then went to check on the woman. 

200
00:09:58,085 --> 00:09:59,216
She was dead.

201
00:09:59,697 --> 00:10:03,072
Did you check to see whether the body was warm or cold?  

202
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:06,186
It was still warm.

203
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,215
She was dead when you got there?   

204
00:10:13,215 --> 00:10:14,710
I believe so. 

205
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,438
Did you see my client kill her?   

206
00:10:16,438 --> 00:10:17,631
No, I did not. 

207
00:10:17,631 --> 00:10:18,788
But she hadn't been dead for very long…

208
00:10:18,788 --> 00:10:22,596
Excuse me. Did you see my client kill her?   

209
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:25,196
No.

210
00:10:25,196 --> 00:10:28,036
Any thumb or finger prints or bruise, indentations

211
00:10:28,036 --> 00:10:29,706
that matched up with my client?

212
00:10:30,246 --> 00:10:31,242
No.

213
00:10:31,242 --> 00:10:34,872
You also noted the woman smelled of garbage?   

214
00:10:34,872 --> 00:10:36,104
Yes.

215
00:10:36,104 --> 00:10:38,120
Any idea how she got this smell?   

216
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:40,999
She was probably in the dumpster.

217
00:10:41,752 --> 00:10:42,955
Thank you, officer.

218
00:10:49,474 --> 00:10:52,012
I think she was hiding in the dumpster, get away from him.

219
00:10:52,012 --> 00:10:53,169
Why not you argue that then?

220
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:54,430
Can't prove it. 

221
00:10:55,136 --> 00:10:57,193
Steak are so tough.

222
00:10:57,193 --> 00:10:58,427
You guys set a date yet?

223
00:10:58,427 --> 00:11:01,127
June 17th. Invitations get next week.  

224
00:11:02,005 --> 00:11:05,387
OK. And now how soon after before we have a little Bobby?

225
00:11:05,387 --> 00:11:06,873
You will be the first to know, Helen.

226
00:11:06,873 --> 00:11:07,875
Of course, I will. 

227
00:11:08,726 --> 00:11:10,801
May I ask you guys something? 

228
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,735
A wedding? A baby?

229
00:11:13,735 --> 00:11:15,115
She has already got me pregnant.

230
00:11:15,115 --> 00:11:17,992
How do you take these cases and go home?

231
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,075
Judge assigned it, Helen.

232
00:11:20,075 --> 00:11:20,723
I know. But you could...

233
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:22,333
What's the point?

234
00:11:23,858 --> 00:11:25,709
I didn't mean anything, Eugene. 

235
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:26,726
I was just asking...

236
00:11:26,726 --> 00:11:28,331
I'm sick of people asking that question. 

237
00:11:28,331 --> 00:11:30,909
It's a stupid question. We get it everywhere we go. 

238
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:31,579
You think about that? 

239
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:33,578
I don't expect to be getting it from a DA.

240
00:11:33,578 --> 00:11:34,351
Eugene.

241
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:37,464
Especially when we are supposed to be having a nice dinner as friends.   

242
00:11:39,608 --> 00:11:43,118
OK. Sorry.

243
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:51,618
Excuse me.

244
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,452
This eyewitness is pretty much their whole case, so if there is...

245
00:12:09,452 --> 00:12:10,722
He is a liar. 

246
00:12:10,722 --> 00:12:13,963
Billy Vicks hasn’t told the truth his whole life, about nothing. 

247
00:12:13,963 --> 00:12:15,786
If I hadn't found that girl first, 

248
00:12:15,786 --> 00:12:18,910
he would have been right there digging his poke. 

249
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,513
You can quote me on that.

250
00:12:20,513 --> 00:12:22,250
I don't believe I will.

251
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,846
Alex, we need facts and truth about Mr. Vicks. 

252
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:28,030
He's a liar. That's a fact.

253
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:28,519
Yes.

254
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:30,827
Can you give us specific incidence of his lie?

255
00:12:30,827 --> 00:12:32,923
Right here. He is lying about this.

256
00:12:34,728 --> 00:12:35,986
OK. 

257
00:12:38,902 --> 00:12:40,324
We will see you in the court room.

258
00:12:40,324 --> 00:12:43,763
he lie about this..

259
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:47,759
digging his poke if he found. of jealousy

260
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,587
We can go with that, Eugene. 

261
00:12:53,587 --> 00:12:55,187
The eyewitness is motivated by jealousy 

262
00:12:55,187 --> 00:12:57,919
because he didn't get to take his poke with the corpse.

263
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,271
This is all funny to you？

264
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:02,264
What am I missing, Eugene? 

265
00:13:03,104 --> 00:13:06,999
You’ve made a career out of defending dirt bags. What's changed?

266
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:08,658
Maybe I am getting sick of it. 

267
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:16,525
Sharon and I split again. 

268
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:21,573
I'm sorry. 

269
00:13:21,573 --> 00:13:22,468
When?

270
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,778
3 days ago. 

271
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,091
Kendall asked me the same question Helen did last night, 

272
00:13:27,091 --> 00:13:29,179
and I couldn't answer it.

273
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:32,566
when she asked me later, we got into this big fight and, 

274
00:13:33,365 --> 00:13:35,723
here I am.

275
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,587
Look, I could handle this case alone, maybe that...

276
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,362
I'm gonna win, Lindsay. 

277
00:13:43,362 --> 00:13:45,602
Make no mistake about that. 

278
00:13:49,044 --> 00:13:50,553
We better get in.

279
00:13:59,821 --> 00:14:03,330
I was at the corner of Washington and Boylston. 

280
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,907
It was about 8:30 or so. 

281
00:14:05,907 --> 00:14:07,036
At night?   

282
00:14:07,036 --> 00:14:07,770
Yes. 

283
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,128
That’s when I saw him.

284
00:14:09,128 --> 00:14:10,633
Him being the defendant?   

285
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:12,140
That’s correct. 

286
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,848
And he was with the woman.

287
00:14:13,848 --> 00:14:15,616
What woman, sir?   

288
00:14:15,616 --> 00:14:20,090
Hilary Brandon. I identified her from the photographs. 

289
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,644
Could you tell what they were doing?   

290
00:14:21,644 --> 00:14:26,066
Talking. I assume Alex was asking her for money.

291
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:28,142
Were they arguing or …?   

292
00:14:28,142 --> 00:14:29,070
No, no, no. 

293
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,716
As a matter of fact, she was smiling.

294
00:14:31,716 --> 00:14:33,548
Do you know the defendant?   

295
00:14:33,548 --> 00:14:36,585
Oh yes. I met him on the street many times. 

296
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:38,669
And you are definitely sure it was him, 

297
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,724
this man talking to Hilary Brandon that night?   

298
00:14:42,518 --> 00:14:44,109
I’m positive.

299
00:14:44,109 --> 00:14:46,628
And you are sure it was around 8:30?   

300
00:14:46,628 --> 00:14:47,981
Yes, I am.

301
00:14:47,981 --> 00:14:49,499
Thank you.

302
00:14:52,468 --> 00:14:55,257
What were you doing on the streets at 8:30, Mr. Vicks?   

303
00:14:55,257 --> 00:14:57,215
I was soliciting clients.

304
00:14:57,215 --> 00:14:58,894
Soliciting clients? 

305
00:14:58,894 --> 00:15:00,003
You were panhandling.   

306
00:15:00,003 --> 00:15:01,577
That’s what some people call it.

307
00:15:01,577 --> 00:15:03,421
You pretty much live on the streets?   

308
00:15:03,421 --> 00:15:04,172
I do.

309
00:15:04,172 --> 00:15:06,506
Did the prosecution buy you those nice clothes?   

310
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:07,230
Objection!

311
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,932
When the witness testifies he puts his demeanor into evidence. 

312
00:15:09,932 --> 00:15:13,532
And this witness has had part of his demeanor paid for by the prosecution.

313
00:15:13,532 --> 00:15:16,357
And exactly where did the defendant’s outfit come from?

314
00:15:16,357 --> 00:15:18,060
From a charity who helps innocent people 

315
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,352
wrongly charged with crimes.

316
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:20,687
-Objection! Move to strike! -All right, all right!

317
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:21,812
That’s enough. 

318
00:15:21,812 --> 00:15:23,898
We will have no more discussion as to wardrobe. 

319
00:15:23,898 --> 00:15:26,753
The jury will not give any weights to the clothes.

320
00:15:26,753 --> 00:15:29,956
You were arrested the night of the murder, weren’t you, Mr. Vicks?   

321
00:15:29,956 --> 00:15:31,684
Yes. But much later.

322
00:15:31,684 --> 00:15:33,373
Drug and disorderly conduct?   

323
00:15:33,373 --> 00:15:35,969
I was sober when I saw your client with…

324
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:39,050
How many times have you been arrested for drug and disorderly conduct, sir?   

325
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:39,739
Objection!

326
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:40,716
Overruled.

327
00:15:40,716 --> 00:15:41,835
More than five?   

328
00:15:41,835 --> 00:15:42,589
Maybe.

329
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:43,601
More than ten?   

330
00:15:43,601 --> 00:15:44,522
I don’t know.

331
00:15:44,522 --> 00:15:46,791
In fact, this was your eleventh time. 

332
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:50,465
And after the last one you were told the next one meant jail time. 

333
00:15:50,465 --> 00:15:52,094
Isn’t that right, Mr. Vicks?   

334
00:15:52,094 --> 00:15:53,078
Yes.

335
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:57,968
Are you going to be serving time for your eleventh arrest?   

336
00:15:57,968 --> 00:15:58,810
I don’t think so.

337
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:01,786
Because you had something to offer, didn’t you, Mr. Vicks? 

338
00:16:01,786 --> 00:16:05,462
You decided to hand over Mr. Dickson in exchange for serving no time. 

339
00:16:05,462 --> 00:16:07,042
Is that why you made this story up?

340
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:07,828
Objection!

341
00:16:07,828 --> 00:16:08,763
Overruled.

342
00:16:08,763 --> 00:16:10,514
Did you make up this story, Mr. Vicks?   

343
00:16:10,514 --> 00:16:11,222
No!

344
00:16:11,222 --> 00:16:14,658
They needed to place my client with the victim alive. 

345
00:16:14,658 --> 00:16:17,089
And you decide to offer your services, didn’t you?

346
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:18,218
I’m not lying. 

347
00:16:18,218 --> 00:16:19,391
I saw him with that woman.

348
00:16:19,391 --> 00:16:22,981
But you did make a deal in exchange for this testimony, 

349
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:24,804
didn’t you, Mr. vicks?

350
00:16:24,804 --> 00:16:25,340
Yes.

351
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,044
Yes. 

352
00:16:26,044 --> 00:16:30,288
And you say you were sober when you saw my client with Miss Brandon. 

353
00:16:30,288 --> 00:16:31,246
Was that your testimony?   

354
00:16:31,246 --> 00:16:32,209
Yes.

355
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:34,090
Well, according to three different witnesses, 

356
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:37,323
you were seen drinking as early as four o’clock that afternoon.   

357
00:16:37,323 --> 00:16:38,713
But I wasn’t drunk.

358
00:16:38,713 --> 00:16:40,858
You are an alcoholic, aren’t you, Mr. Vicks?   

359
00:16:40,858 --> 00:16:41,977
Well, I like to drink, yeah. 

360
00:16:41,977 --> 00:16:44,286
But why that makes me alcoholic?

361
00:16:44,286 --> 00:16:45,329
Nothing further.

362
00:16:59,698 --> 00:17:03,094
You’ve known he had AIDS for three years?

363
00:17:03,094 --> 00:17:06,605
Yes. And I kept the secret. 

364
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:08,671
Well, what changed?

365
00:17:08,671 --> 00:17:10,920
I saw on the news. 

366
00:17:13,311 --> 00:17:17,610
These two guys stopped to help this guy in a car accident. 

367
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,497
He wasn’t breathing. 

368
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,445
They both did mouth to mouth. 

369
00:17:21,445 --> 00:17:25,794
turned out the accident victim had AIDS. 

370
00:17:26,598 --> 00:17:29,038
And now these two Samaritans are at risk. 

371
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:31,622
They have to go for AIDS test for the next few years. 

372
00:17:32,471 --> 00:17:36,164
So I thought what if something like that happens here. 

373
00:17:36,164 --> 00:17:41,380
Suppose Wayne has heart attack, or he blacks out. 

374
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,101
It certainly is possible given his immune system. 

375
00:17:45,101 --> 00:17:49,380
And then suppose somebody at work goes to resuscitate him? 

376
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,166
Wouldn’t I be a little bit liable? 

377
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:55,030
I know he has AIDS. I don’t tell? 

378
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,147
There are people who work for me.

379
00:17:57,147 --> 00:18:00,272
So you felt it was your legal responsibility?

380
00:18:00,272 --> 00:18:02,289
And my moral one, to be honest. 

381
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:05,124
I put my trust in these people. 

382
00:18:05,124 --> 00:18:08,199
And I asked these people to trust me. 

383
00:18:10,282 --> 00:18:13,484
How can I sit on information 

384
00:18:13,484 --> 00:18:16,714
that could possibly threaten their lives?

385
00:18:16,714 --> 00:18:21,182
Did any doctor advise you 

386
00:18:21,182 --> 00:18:24,781
that Mr. Mayfield might be a health risk to anybody else?   

387
00:18:24,781 --> 00:18:25,338
No.

388
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:29,854
Did any medical professional advise you to reveal my client’s condition? 

389
00:18:29,854 --> 00:18:30,685
No. 

390
00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:36,057
But probably because doctors are more afraid of being sued than anybody.

391
00:18:36,057 --> 00:18:37,768
Did you consider the possibility 

392
00:18:37,768 --> 00:18:41,240
that Mr. Mayfield maybe stigmatized by your memo, 

393
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:46,504
that he might suffer from discrimination as a result of this disclosure?

394
00:18:46,504 --> 00:18:47,729
Yes. 

395
00:18:47,729 --> 00:18:53,776
But I weigh that risk against the potentially fatal one facing the others. 

396
00:18:53,776 --> 00:18:55,875
And I made my decision. 

397
00:18:56,737 --> 00:18:58,295
I’d also like to say I feel that 

398
00:18:58,295 --> 00:18:59,956
the company supported me. 

399
00:18:59,956 --> 00:19:03,254
He resent sympathy as he stated in his testimony. 

400
00:19:03,254 --> 00:19:06,622
And a lot of the discrimination he says he was subjected to,

401
00:19:06,622 --> 00:19:10,142
The bulk of it he only perceived.

402
00:19:10,142 --> 00:19:13,374
The employees at Straub like him. 

403
00:19:13,374 --> 00:19:15,646
Following my disclosure, 

404
00:19:15,646 --> 00:19:18,654
nobody came to me asking that he be let go. 

405
00:19:18,654 --> 00:19:21,764
And I think that needs to be said.

406
00:19:30,945 --> 00:19:32,873
You said it perfectly.

407
00:19:32,873 --> 00:19:34,130
How is it going?

408
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:37,735
He totally stunned them. Now they are willing to take 125,000.

409
00:19:37,735 --> 00:19:38,415
Really?

410
00:19:38,415 --> 00:19:39,717
We rejected it. 

411
00:19:39,717 --> 00:19:40,964
You should have seen them.

412
00:19:40,964 --> 00:19:42,249
Is the Jury still out?

413
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:42,566
No. 

414
00:19:42,566 --> 00:19:44,499
We go back in there at five for closing argument

415
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:45,735
which I get to get work on. 

416
00:19:45,735 --> 00:19:46,316
Come on.

417
00:19:46,316 --> 00:19:48,273
How about when I said it was the moral thing? 

418
00:19:48,273 --> 00:19:49,881
Did you see his face when I said that?

419
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:50,670
Did I see it? 

420
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,446
I can hear it when that hit the floor.

421
00:19:52,446 --> 00:19:53,597
He was so cocky. 

422
00:19:53,597 --> 00:19:55,577
That’s the way they are, Jimmy, I am telling you. 

423
00:19:55,577 --> 00:19:57,763
They get all these special treatment, 

424
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,848
and they get all these special laws passed, 

425
00:19:59,848 --> 00:20:02,616
they get the whole country screaming let them get married. 

426
00:20:02,616 --> 00:20:06,227
I mean, it’s like they're some privileged class or something. 

427
00:20:06,227 --> 00:20:09,010
**, it's out of control. 

428
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:11,781
He thinks he is smarter than everybody too. 

429
00:20:11,781 --> 00:20:14,966
That’s why they thought they'd win this.

430
00:20:21,131 --> 00:20:23,999
Ever tell you my mother was gay, Peter?

431
00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:25,759
What? 

432
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:28,063
Funny.

433
00:20:28,063 --> 00:20:30,809
No. It’s true. 

434
00:20:31,783 --> 00:20:32,782
Maybe I didn’t mention it 

435
00:20:32,782 --> 00:20:35,054
because I didn’t think it was such a big deal 

436
00:20:35,054 --> 00:20:37,290
that it would matter to my friends.

437
00:20:38,578 --> 00:20:42,139
All right, Jimmy. **

438
00:20:42,687 --> 00:20:44,507
Come on, you know me. 

439
00:20:44,507 --> 00:20:48,185
I got no problem of people living the way they want. 

440
00:20:48,185 --> 00:20:49,267
It’s just…

441
00:20:51,087 --> 00:20:52,662
as you know.

442
00:20:53,054 --> 00:20:54,661
The special treatment.   

443
00:20:54,661 --> 00:20:56,051
Yes. 

444
00:21:00,605 --> 00:21:02,929
Well, I better work on my closing. 

445
00:21:03,426 --> 00:21:05,440
You know what you're gonna say?

446
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,179
I have an idea.

447
00:21:14,894 --> 00:21:19,695
Body cools down about 1 degree per hour in 65 degree weather, 

448
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,228
which was that evening. 

449
00:21:21,228 --> 00:21:24,855
And we recorded a base temperature of 95.5. 

450
00:21:24,855 --> 00:21:26,656
That was just after midnight. 

451
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:29,076
Competing the 1 degree per hour, 

452
00:21:29,076 --> 00:21:32,467
we calculated the time of death to be between 9 and 10 o’clock. 

453
00:21:32,467 --> 00:21:35,065
Since the officer found the dead at 9:30, 

454
00:21:35,065 --> 00:21:38,821
we determined the TOD to be between 9 and 9:30. 

455
00:21:38,821 --> 00:21:42,346
Were you able to determine the cause of death, Dr. Fine?

456
00:21:42,346 --> 00:21:45,970
It's asphyxiation, caused by strangulation. 	

457
00:21:46,778 --> 00:21:49,739
Between 9:00 and 9:30, 

458
00:21:49,739 --> 00:21:54,420
so Miss Brandon could have been killed at 9:01, possible?

459
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,547
Possible.

460
00:21:55,547 --> 00:22:00,437
So my client’s contention that he found the body already dead around 9:15 

461
00:22:00,437 --> 00:22:03,704
then preceded to make love with it after she was dead, 

462
00:22:03,704 --> 00:22:05,030
that’s possible, isn’t it?

463
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,452
It’s possible, but it’s…

464
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:10,950
Well in fact, scientifically you can’t rule out that possibility at all?

465
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,236
No, I can’t rule it out.

466
00:22:13,236 --> 00:22:15,594
In fact, a body temperature will **

467
00:22:15,594 --> 00:22:18,895
if a person was struggling prior to death, wouldn’t it? 

468
00:22:18,895 --> 00:22:22,481
She could have been 100 when she died, isn’t that possible?  

469
00:22:23,205 --> 00:22:24,336
Yes.

470
00:22:24,336 --> 00:22:29,015
So she might have been killed as early as 7, 7:30?

471
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:31,682
Well, a witness saw her alive at 8:30.

472
00:22:31,682 --> 00:22:33,302
So you based your findings 

473
00:22:33,302 --> 00:22:36,992
in part on the reliability of the witness Billy Vicks?

474
00:22:36,992 --> 00:22:38,390
Yes, I am.

475
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,337
Thank you, Dr. Fine.

476
00:22:41,747 --> 00:22:43,758
The witness may step down. 

477
00:22:45,266 --> 00:22:46,478
Miss Gamble?

478
00:22:46,478 --> 00:22:49,024
The prosecution rest, your honor.

479
00:22:49,024 --> 00:22:51,782
Mr. Young, your're on.

480
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:58,515
The defense rests, your honor.

481
00:23:08,148 --> 00:23:10,786
How do you mean I don’t testify?

482
00:23:10,786 --> 00:23:12,391
I mean you don’t testify.

483
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,017
What’s with that? If I don’t tell my side,…

484
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:18,622
If we put you on the stand, all your other felonies come in, 

485
00:23:18,622 --> 00:23:21,912
including the time you flash kids at an elementary school. 

486
00:23:21,912 --> 00:23:23,397
That doesn’t make me a killer.

487
00:23:23,397 --> 00:23:25,705
It makes you a piece of crap which we don’t need the jury to hear.

488
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:26,512
They already think that. 

489
00:23:26,512 --> 00:23:27,582
I slept with that woman. 

490
00:23:27,582 --> 00:23:28,713
You take the stand, they’ll know it.

491
00:23:28,713 --> 00:23:29,671
OK！All right! 

492
00:23:29,671 --> 00:23:30,712
I don’t like this. What’s going on?

493
00:23:30,712 --> 00:23:32,585
You have to trust us on this, Mr. Dickson.

494
00:23:32,585 --> 00:23:34,286
I don’t put on any defence. What the hell was that?

495
00:23:34,286 --> 00:23:35,357
You don’t have any defence. 

496
00:23:35,357 --> 00:23:37,204
You were caught red handed raping the victim.

497
00:23:37,204 --> 00:23:38,226
After she was dead.

498
00:23:38,226 --> 00:23:39,623
Alex, the jury won’t believe you. 

499
00:23:39,623 --> 00:23:40,221
How do you know?

500
00:23:40,221 --> 00:23:40,973
Because I don’t believe you.

501
00:23:40,973 --> 00:23:41,366
Eugene!

502
00:23:41,366 --> 00:23:42,100
I think you did it. 

503
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,651
You strangled and raped her, that’s what I think. 

504
00:23:43,651 --> 00:23:46,294
Because I have the pleasure of listening to your talk, 

505
00:23:46,294 --> 00:23:49,293
I don’t want the Jury to hear you open your fat mouth, 

506
00:23:49,293 --> 00:23:51,288
coz they’ll know you did it, just like I do. 

507
00:23:51,288 --> 00:23:53,718
I have an obligation to protect you, Alex, 

508
00:23:53,718 --> 00:23:54,812
and your fat mouth.

509
00:23:54,812 --> 00:23:55,681
You listen to me! 

510
00:23:55,681 --> 00:23:57,520
Don’t you wanna mess with me!

511
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,783
Eugene, stop it! 

512
00:24:13,575 --> 00:24:15,234
Mr. Dickson, 

513
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,306
our defense is the state hasn’t satisfied its burden of proof.

514
00:24:19,306 --> 00:24:22,362
With that strategy, it’s better not to call in any witnesses. 

515
00:24:22,362 --> 00:24:24,281
That’s why we are not calling you.

516
00:24:24,281 --> 00:24:26,500
Certainly it’s your right to testify. 

517
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,172
And if you insist, we will allow you to do so. 

518
00:24:29,172 --> 00:24:30,737
But it’s our collective judgment. 

519
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,163
It’s better for us to rest without putting on a defense,

520
00:24:35,163 --> 00:24:38,524
and focus the jury on the state’s failure to make its burden. 

521
00:24:38,524 --> 00:24:42,583
And as it stands, we have a very good chance. 

522
00:24:47,282 --> 00:24:48,589
I don’t know what’s going on, 

523
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:53,177
but gay bashing seems to become back to style. 

524
00:24:53,177 --> 00:24:55,614
We got radio talk show’s hosts proudly 

525
00:24:55,614 --> 00:24:57,701
declaring their prejudices, 

526
00:24:57,701 --> 00:25:01,837
churches and politicians calling gay people sick,

527
00:25:01,837 --> 00:25:06,832
voters coming out and droves to support bans on gay marriages…

528
00:25:06,837 --> 00:25:09,208
What is going on? 

529
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,811
As far as fear of AIDS goes, 

530
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:15,696
you want something really to be scared about? 

531
00:25:16,775 --> 00:25:19,401
Abolish people’s right to medical privacy, 

532
00:25:19,401 --> 00:25:21,724
and they simply won’t get tested. 

533
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:25,390
They will stop going to the doctors, 

534
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,602
then watch the disease spread, many diseases. 

535
00:25:29,885 --> 00:25:33,821
This man went and got tested, 

536
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,676
and he was punished for it.

537
00:25:37,774 --> 00:25:40,582
Is that the message we want to be sending? 

538
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:46,827
Because if that’s it, then a plague on all our houses. 

539
00:25:52,527 --> 00:25:53,907
What was he talking about? 

540
00:25:53,907 --> 00:25:56,042
Gay backlash?

541
00:25:56,042 --> 00:26:00,668
Gays have got more special treatment going than anybody. 

542
00:26:00,668 --> 00:26:03,549
We got special AIDS laws. 

543
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:06,441
Hollywood, the army, the Oscars, 

544
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:09,057
they all got those red ribbons on, don’t they, 

545
00:26:09,057 --> 00:26:10,863
in honor of AIDS? 

546
00:26:10,863 --> 00:26:13,294
My dad died of a heart attack. 

547
00:26:13,294 --> 00:26:16,581
Where is the ribbon for cardiovascular disease? 

548
00:26:16,581 --> 00:26:22,976
And now, when a person has a fatal deadly infectious disease, 

549
00:26:22,976 --> 00:26:26,332
there is a law that says you can’t even warn people. 

550
00:26:27,014 --> 00:26:31,169
Nobody say we should discriminate against people with AIDS, 

551
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:34,369
but where is the law to protect you and me? 

552
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:38,919
Where is the legislation to protect Mr. Mayfield’s coworkers? 

553
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:43,437
If he dropped, a dozen different people would be giving him mouth to mouth. 

554
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:45,569
If he got cut playing basketball, 

555
00:26:45,569 --> 00:26:47,525
his teammate would help attend to it. 

556
00:26:48,595 --> 00:26:52,876
They don’t have a right to know they could be risking their lives? 

557
00:26:52,876 --> 00:26:55,236
How not is that? 

558
00:26:55,236 --> 00:26:58,204
Doesn’t Mr. Hines own some duty 

559
00:26:58,204 --> 00:27:00,651
to look out for the people who work for him? 

560
00:27:00,651 --> 00:27:06,019
He did the moral thing, the reasonable thing. 

561
00:27:06,636 --> 00:27:09,877
And let’s remind ourselves one more time, 

562
00:27:09,877 --> 00:27:13,714
the plaintiff didn’t get fired, nobody beat him up. 

563
00:27:13,714 --> 00:27:16,710
Mr. Mayfield says he even felt depressed by the people 

564
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:19,031
who were trying to help him, for God’s sakes. 

565
00:27:19,031 --> 00:27:21,271
Maybe we should pass another law. 

566
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:26,109
It’s a crime to show too much sympathy for people with AIDS. 

567
00:27:26,817 --> 00:27:30,965
Enough is enough.

568
00:27:48,218 --> 00:27:49,490
How are we doing?

569
00:27:50,224 --> 00:27:51,629
I think we are OK.

570
00:27:54,401 --> 00:27:55,887
How are you doing?

571
00:27:55,887 --> 00:27:57,842
I’m fine, Lindsay.

572
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:58,375
Eugene.

573
00:27:58,375 --> 00:28:00,875
Don’t start playing psychologist with me, OK?

574
00:28:02,737 --> 00:28:04,418
Are you seeing any psychologist? 

575
00:28:04,418 --> 00:28:06,849
Because I think you should be.

576
00:28:06,849 --> 00:28:07,862
Is that right?

577
00:28:07,862 --> 00:28:08,587
Yes. 

578
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:11,714
Every time you take cases like this,

579
00:28:11,714 --> 00:28:12,962
you just, you turn angry. 

580
00:28:12,962 --> 00:28:14,776
-I mean the …beat up at court. -It doesn’t have to be fun, Lindsay.

581
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:15,943
What am I supposed to do? 

582
00:28:15,943 --> 00:28:17,046
Be all happy, Lindsay? 

583
00:28:17,046 --> 00:28:19,308
These cases don’t bother me, OK?

584
00:28:19,308 --> 00:28:20,708
Whatever you're feeling…

585
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:22,715
I don’t feel anything. I am a defense attorney. 

586
00:28:22,715 --> 00:28:24,195
It’s not my job to feel. 

587
00:28:24,195 --> 00:28:25,894
Why can’t people see that? 

588
00:28:36,178 --> 00:28:38,751
I have work to do, Lindsay.

589
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:49,690
I think I should do the closing. 

590
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:50,676
I will do it.

591
00:28:50,676 --> 00:28:53,176
If you can’t do your best…

592
00:28:53,176 --> 00:28:55,234
I will do my very best. 

593
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:58,324
Cases like this…

594
00:28:58,563 --> 00:29:03,026
I guess I'm afraid I'll let my personal disgust affect my head.

595
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:09,952
I compensate by trying harder. 

596
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:14,699
If anything I tried even harder for the guilty. 

597
00:29:17,368 --> 00:29:20,214
How sick is that?

598
00:29:28,282 --> 00:29:30,085
They've reached a verdict already? 

599
00:29:30,085 --> 00:29:31,532
I’m on my way. 

600
00:29:31,532 --> 00:29:37,755
Jimmy, my spies at the courthouse said your closing seemed a little rednecked?

601
00:29:37,755 --> 00:29:40,011
I went and I thought what I said would be effective.

602
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:40,986
Red neck?

603
00:29:40,986 --> 00:29:43,280
Red, white, and blue. 

604
00:29:43,937 --> 00:29:45,298
I better go.

605
00:29:56,298 --> 00:29:58,882
If there is a question defense attorneys get asked 

606
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:00,310
more than anything else, 

607
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:05,374
it’s how can you do it. 

608
00:30:06,732 --> 00:30:10,606
How can you walk in the court day after day after day 

609
00:30:10,606 --> 00:30:12,593
defending the scum of the earth, 

610
00:30:12,593 --> 00:30:15,755
then go home and sleep? 

611
00:30:18,714 --> 00:30:23,034
Well, I got myself a pretty good piece of scum in this one, don’t I? 

612
00:30:23,034 --> 00:30:24,807
He raped a dead woman. 

613
00:30:25,868 --> 00:30:28,830
Hard enough for me to even look at him, let along defend him. 

614
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,116
But the answer to the question is 

615
00:30:31,116 --> 00:30:35,128
I don’t come in here day after day representing people like him. 

616
00:30:35,128 --> 00:30:37,818
I represent you and me. 

617
00:30:37,818 --> 00:30:41,427
I’m in here making sure the prosecution lives up to its burden 

618
00:30:41,427 --> 00:30:43,945
of proving guilty beyond reasonable doubt 

619
00:30:43,945 --> 00:30:46,366
before they get to incarcerate people. 

620
00:30:46,366 --> 00:30:48,528
Because if they don’t live up to their burden, 

621
00:30:48,528 --> 00:30:52,248
if we start letting them convict without meeting that criteria, 

622
00:30:52,248 --> 00:30:54,399
then innocent people are at risk, 

623
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,936
you and me, 

624
00:30:58,078 --> 00:30:59,478
maybe him too.

625
00:30:59,478 --> 00:31:00,720
I don’t know. 

626
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,940
Maybe he killed that woman, maybe he didn’t. 

627
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,703
I can’t tell you. 

628
00:31:03,703 --> 00:31:07,711
What I can say is they didn’t satisfy their burden. 

629
00:31:07,711 --> 00:31:09,829
There is doubt all over the place. 

630
00:31:09,829 --> 00:31:12,046
Nobody saw him commit a murder. 

631
00:31:12,046 --> 00:31:14,493
The coroner himself said the murder could have happened 

632
00:31:14,493 --> 00:31:16,830
hours before the police officer found him. 

633
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:20,473
It’s not likely he is gonna hang around with this victim for hours, is he? 

634
00:31:20,473 --> 00:31:24,042
No thumb prints and bruises around the neck matches my client. 

635
00:31:24,042 --> 00:31:26,319
The victim smelled like garbage, why? 

636
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:28,316
Because she was in that dumpster, 

637
00:31:28,316 --> 00:31:31,274
just like my client said she was when he found her. 

638
00:31:31,274 --> 00:31:35,001
One witness who places my client with the victim alive 

639
00:31:35,001 --> 00:31:36,358
turns out to be a drunk, 

640
00:31:36,358 --> 00:31:38,122
likely drunk at the time. 

641
00:31:38,122 --> 00:31:40,594
Can we really trust his powers of observation?

642
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:42,613
or his creditability?

643
00:31:42,613 --> 00:31:46,504
The testimony he gave was part of a deal that kept him out of jail. 

644
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:47,209
Deal…

645
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:49,050
What I should say is bribe, 

646
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:51,257
he had a motive to lie. 

647
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,336
Now the only thing they can prove 

648
00:31:54,336 --> 00:31:57,134
is that my client was having sex with that dead body. 

649
00:31:57,134 --> 00:31:59,063
Does that make him wild? Absolutely. 

650
00:31:59,063 --> 00:32:01,736
But it in no way proves he committed a homicide. 

651
00:32:01,736 --> 00:32:04,504
It certainly doesn’t prove it beyond reasonable doubt. 

652
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,885
Miss Gamble started things off calling this ugly. 

653
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:12,833
It is ugly. Sometimes, the job is ugly. 

654
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:16,519
I got to come in here and fight for a system I believe in 

655
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:18,679
even I don’t like my client. 

656
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:20,813
And it gets ugly for juries, too. 

657
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:26,109
Because doing your job here means finding that man not guilty, 

658
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:29,246
it absolutely means that under the facts we had. 

659
00:32:30,384 --> 00:32:34,337
Now I can’t stop you from saying, the hell with the rules. 

660
00:32:34,337 --> 00:32:37,299
I can’t prevent you from lowing the burden of prove, 

661
00:32:37,299 --> 00:32:38,974
if that's what you choose to do. 

662
00:32:38,974 --> 00:32:41,461
I will ask you to consider. 

663
00:32:42,186 --> 00:32:45,941
What if one day you, or somebody you love 

664
00:32:45,941 --> 00:32:49,286
is charged with a crime you or he didn’t commit, 

665
00:32:49,286 --> 00:32:53,374
how would you feel if you, he, or she got a jury 

666
00:32:53,374 --> 00:32:55,244
who dispense with the burden of prove

667
00:32:55,244 --> 00:32:58,639
and just said, close enough. 

668
00:32:58,957 --> 00:33:01,206
It happens. 

669
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,857
Those are against every grain of our criminal justice system, 

670
00:33:05,857 --> 00:33:06,624
but it happens, 

671
00:33:06,624 --> 00:33:09,350
violate every principle of our constitution, 

672
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,143
but it happens. 

673
00:33:10,143 --> 00:33:11,843
The only question we have here is 

674
00:33:11,843 --> 00:33:14,623
is it going to happen today. 

675
00:33:15,436 --> 00:33:18,805
It is possible that he did find her dead. 

676
00:33:18,805 --> 00:33:19,517
It is possible. 

677
00:33:19,517 --> 00:33:21,851
There is nothing they can do to disprove that possibility, 

678
00:33:21,851 --> 00:33:23,912
definitely not beyond reasonable doubt. 

679
00:33:23,912 --> 00:33:27,075
That’s a fact, a fact you can take back into that room. 

680
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:35,058
In order for the system to work, 

681
00:33:35,058 --> 00:33:38,209
we need the defense attorneys to do their job 

682
00:33:38,209 --> 00:33:40,940
even when it is unpopular to do so. 

683
00:33:41,932 --> 00:33:45,866
In order for the system to work, 

684
00:33:47,014 --> 00:33:51,073
we need the juries to do their jobs. 

685
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,490
Like Miss Gamble said, 

686
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:02,479
sometimes the job is ugly.

687
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:35,441
Very few cases is the defendant actually seen committing a murder. 

688
00:34:36,262 --> 00:34:40,642
The jury is allowed to consider circumstantial evidence 

689
00:34:40,642 --> 00:34:42,638
when making its finding.

690
00:34:42,638 --> 00:34:46,637
Here, the defendant was found raping the victim 

691
00:34:46,637 --> 00:34:49,154
while her body was still warm. 

692
00:34:50,794 --> 00:34:56,758
Our system of criminal justice doesn’t preclude you from using common sense. 

693
00:34:57,483 --> 00:35:00,211
Anything is possible, ladies and gentlemen. 

694
00:35:00,859 --> 00:35:02,007
And our burden…

695
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:06,560
it isn’t proved beyond all doubt. 

696
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,097
It’s proved beyond all reasonable doubt. 

697
00:35:11,949 --> 00:35:14,483
He was seen with her alive. 

698
00:35:14,483 --> 00:35:16,651
He was discovered with her dead. 

699
00:35:17,413 --> 00:35:19,916
Gee, I wonder what happened.

700
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:39,569
In the matter of Mayfield vs. Straub Industries, 

701
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:43,194
we find in favor of the plaintiff Wayne Mayfield 

702
00:35:43,194 --> 00:35:46,250
and order the defendant to pay damages 

703
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:49,719
in the amount of 25 dollars. 

704
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:52,931
Jury is dismissed with the thanks of the court. 

705
00:35:52,931 --> 00:35:55,017
We are adjourned.  

706
00:35:56,662 --> 00:35:58,653
Did he say 25 dollars?   

707
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,395
Yeah. 

708
00:36:02,395 --> 00:36:04,144
We won basicly.   

709
00:36:04,144 --> 00:36:06,158
Yeah, you did, Peter. 

710
00:36:06,158 --> 00:36:07,755
You are a big winner. 

711
00:36:07,755 --> 00:36:09,572
It was your closing, Jimmy.   

712
00:36:10,175 --> 00:36:13,241
Well, you inspired it. 

713
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,938
You got something to say?   

714
00:36:19,183 --> 00:36:22,191
Yeah. I think you are a bigot. 

715
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:25,410
I also think you revealing his condition, 

716
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,785
you probably meant to create a climate 

717
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:29,945
that will make him want to leave. 

718
00:36:30,293 --> 00:36:32,462
Mission accomplished, Pete. 

719
00:36:35,114 --> 00:36:39,018
Growing up, you thought they were just as sick as I did. 

720
00:36:39,018 --> 00:36:40,119
Come on.    

721
00:36:40,873 --> 00:36:44,293
The difference is I grew up. 

722
00:37:00,621 --> 00:37:03,013
Did I handle myself OK?

723
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:09,218
You did great. I got goose bumps. 

724
00:37:09,218 --> 00:37:11,988
I was suddenly proud to be a defense attorney again. 

725
00:37:11,988 --> 00:37:14,766
That’s for sure, you should be proud. 

726
00:37:17,257 --> 00:37:18,999
Do you really mean that?

727
00:37:21,047 --> 00:37:22,463
You know… 

728
00:37:22,463 --> 00:37:25,058
we are trained not to ask ourselves a big question, 

729
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,959
how can you defend murderers and rapists. 

730
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:31,557
We’re trained not to go near there because if we do, 

731
00:37:31,557 --> 00:37:33,053
we will end up in mess. 

732
00:37:33,053 --> 00:37:36,930
So, we stay away, far away, 

733
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:41,223
until one day we don’t even recognize the question. 

734
00:37:41,848 --> 00:37:47,141
And when people ask us, we were just act like you don’t get it. 

735
00:37:47,141 --> 00:37:50,826
So, maybe they are the ones that lost. 

736
00:37:53,016 --> 00:37:54,853
And it hits you. 

737
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:59,150
Maybe we are the ones who lost. 

738
00:38:06,806 --> 00:38:11,405
There is honor in what you do, Eugene. 

739
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:15,099
You may not believe your own words in there. 

740
00:38:16,575 --> 00:38:18,241
But I do. 

741
00:38:20,848 --> 00:38:23,334
She said I can’t feel. 

742
00:38:24,222 --> 00:38:25,573
Who?

743
00:38:25,773 --> 00:38:27,167
Sharon. 

744
00:38:28,662 --> 00:38:30,991
And she's right. 

745
00:38:32,674 --> 00:38:34,475
I can’t feel.

746
00:38:34,631 --> 00:38:37,623
I’m afraid to let myself feel. 

747
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:42,099
Maybe that’s why I can be so damn honorable. 

748
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:55,945
Lock up when you go?

749
00:38:55,945 --> 00:38:56,901
Yeah. 

750
00:38:59,851 --> 00:39:01,125
Hey, mom. 

751
00:39:01,597 --> 00:39:02,054
No. 

752
00:39:02,054 --> 00:39:05,197
I'm still at the office, just getting ready to leave.

753
00:39:05,998 --> 00:39:07,510
Oh, you got accompany? 

754
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,784
I’ll let you go. 

755
00:39:10,936 --> 00:39:12,131
No, no, nothing’s wrong. 

756
00:39:12,131 --> 00:39:15,285
I was just calling to say Hi, that's all. 

757
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,878
How is everything going? 

758
00:39:20,382 --> 00:39:22,339
Yeah. Same. 

759
00:39:22,339 --> 00:39:23,780
Pretty normal.

760
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:27,194
No, no, nothing is wrong. 

761
00:39:27,194 --> 00:39:30,078
I was just calling 

762
00:39:30,556 --> 00:39:33,160
let you know I was thinking of you, that's all.

763
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:36,519
Well, we'll talk tomorrow. 

764
00:39:37,642 --> 00:39:39,250
All right. 

765
00:39:39,941 --> 00:39:41,939
Love you, too. 

766
00:40:13,341 --> 00:40:15,442
Will the defendant please rise? 

767
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:19,838
Has the jury reached its verdict?

768
00:40:20,694 --> 00:40:21,851
We have, your honor.

769
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:22,952
What say you?

770
00:40:25,107 --> 00:40:29,225
Account 32623 on the charge of murder in the first degree, 

771
00:40:29,225 --> 00:40:32,463
we found the defendant Alex Dickson 

772
00:40:32,969 --> 00:40:34,619
not guilty. 

773
00:40:35,518 --> 00:40:37,544
On the account of murder in the second degree, 

774
00:40:37,544 --> 00:40:38,733
we found the defendant 

775
00:40:38,733 --> 00:40:39,950
not guilty. 

776
00:40:40,568 --> 00:40:44,347
On the account of lascivious and unnatural acts, 

777
00:40:44,347 --> 00:40:45,931
we found the defendant 

778
00:40:45,931 --> 00:40:46,903
guilty. 

779
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:49,831
The defendant is sentenced 6 months. 

780
00:40:49,831 --> 00:40:52,557
Credited with time served, he is free to go. 

781
00:40:52,557 --> 00:40:54,575
Let’s conclude the jury's service. 

782
00:40:54,575 --> 00:40:56,098
We are adjourned. 

783
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:03,015
I don't believe it. I don't believe it. 

784
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,082
So, can I go?

785
00:41:05,082 --> 00:41:07,814
Check with probation and you can go.
