1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,645
When did this happen?

2
00:00:03,645 --> 00:00:04,499
Eight days ago.

3
00:00:04,499 --> 00:00:06,679
Why didn’t the hospital notify the police?

4
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:09,425
Admitting says he wasn’t convinced the crime had been committed.

5
00:00:09,425 --> 00:00:10,219
I don’t believe him. 

6
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:12,203
He also says he wanted her to heal first 

7
00:00:12,203 --> 00:00:14,065
before asking any tough questions.

8
00:00:14,065 --> 00:00:15,374
That maybe true.

9
00:00:15,374 --> 00:00:16,493
She’s been read her rights?

10
00:00:16,493 --> 00:00:17,737
Twice.

11
00:00:17,737 --> 00:00:18,787
She didn’t ask for a lawyer?

12
00:00:18,787 --> 00:00:21,497
She hadn't said anything, she won’t talk.

13
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:32,925
Hi, Jenny, 

14
00:00:32,925 --> 00:00:34,721
my name is Helen Gamble.

15
00:00:35,421 --> 00:00:37,074
I am a District Attorney.

16
00:00:37,074 --> 00:00:38,693
I know you're scared, 

17
00:00:38,693 --> 00:00:42,215
being brought in by the police, you must be terrified.

18
00:00:43,341 --> 00:00:45,410
I am not the police, okay?

19
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,551
And I think I can help you, 

20
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:50,657
But you're gonna have to trust me first.

21
00:00:50,657 --> 00:00:52,904
I...I just wanna leave.

22
00:00:52,904 --> 00:00:55,050
And I will make sure you do.

23
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:58,096
But first, I…

24
00:00:58,889 --> 00:01:01,833
I just want you to tell me what happened, okay?

25
00:01:02,561 --> 00:01:04,986
Now, Doctor Mathew said you tried to kill yourself, 

26
00:01:04,986 --> 00:01:06,048
is that true?

27
00:01:07,728 --> 00:01:09,423
Can you tell me why?

28
00:01:09,423 --> 00:01:11,691
Because…

29
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:14,685
I know this stuff is hard to talk about. 

30
00:01:14,685 --> 00:01:16,118
So I’ll tell you what,

31
00:01:16,923 --> 00:01:18,249
I’ll tell you what I do know,

32
00:01:18,249 --> 00:01:20,769
and you can fill in some of the blanks, all right?

33
00:01:20,769 --> 00:01:23,506
You mom threw you out of the house.

34
00:01:23,506 --> 00:01:26,418
When did she throw you out, Jenny?

35
00:01:26,418 --> 00:01:27,579
The day before.

36
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:30,175
The day before you tried to take your life?

37
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:31,319
Yes.

38
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:32,851
Did she throw you out because 

39
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:34,801
she was angry that you were pregnant?

40
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,681
Yes.

41
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:38,759
And you were seven months?

42
00:01:41,276 --> 00:01:43,581
Why was she so upset, do you know?

43
00:01:45,246 --> 00:01:47,172
She’s always saying 

44
00:01:47,172 --> 00:01:49,330
don’t go and get knocked up.

45
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,356
It’s a big thing with her.

46
00:01:51,356 --> 00:01:55,582
So when she found out, she kind of went berserk and stuff,

47
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:58,779
told me my life would be ruined and… 

48
00:01:58,779 --> 00:02:00,557
I don’t know.

49
00:02:00,557 --> 00:02:02,208
What about your dad?

50
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:03,698
I don’t have a dad.

51
00:02:04,526 --> 00:02:08,409
My mother doesn’t even know who he is or was.

52
00:02:10,193 --> 00:02:12,927
I think that’s…

53
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:15,932
she got knocked up.

54
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,159
I was probably the baby that ruined her life.

55
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:25,115
You being pregnant, that’s sort of a huge disaster, uh?

56
00:02:25,115 --> 00:02:28,139
Were you upset when she threw you out of the house?

57
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:29,693
Yes.

58
00:02:30,265 --> 00:02:33,515
Is that the reason you try to kill yourself?

59
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:36,439
Probably.

60
00:02:38,587 --> 00:02:41,316
Are you really gonna help me?

61
00:02:41,316 --> 00:02:43,153
You have my word.

62
00:02:45,551 --> 00:02:49,021
I saw that after you stabbed yourself, 

63
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:52,093
I see you then got yourself to a hospital.

64
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:58,403
Did you then decide you really wanted to live?

65
00:02:58,403 --> 00:02:59,816
Yeah.

66
00:02:59,816 --> 00:03:03,852
It was hurting so bad, I just wanted the pain to go away.

67
00:03:04,676 --> 00:03:06,454
Did you really think you would kill yourself 

68
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:09,116
by stabbing yourself in the stomach, Jenny?

69
00:03:09,116 --> 00:03:11,406
I don’t know.

70
00:03:14,676 --> 00:03:17,663
When I was 19, I got pregnant. 

71
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:20,828
I had an abortion.

72
00:03:20,828 --> 00:03:23,406
I was way too young for a baby.

73
00:03:25,424 --> 00:03:27,784
What are you? 15?

74
00:03:27,784 --> 00:03:31,055
Look, kid, it’s okay.

75
00:03:31,055 --> 00:03:33,024
You need to talk about this,

76
00:03:33,024 --> 00:03:35,472
you can’t try to bury this alone.

77
00:03:35,472 --> 00:03:36,742
Trust me.

78
00:03:36,742 --> 00:03:39,423
I tried to keep everything inside 

79
00:03:39,423 --> 00:03:43,918
and it caused me more pain than anything else in my whole life.

80
00:03:43,918 --> 00:03:46,220
It’s okay to talk about it, Jenny.

81
00:03:48,727 --> 00:03:50,769
When you stabbed yourself,

82
00:03:51,654 --> 00:03:55,132
you were only tring to kill the baby, weren’t you?

83
00:03:55,132 --> 00:03:57,539
It’s okay, Jenny. 

84
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:59,793
You are only 15 years old, for…

85
00:03:59,793 --> 00:04:01,978
You just tried to raise a child 

86
00:04:01,978 --> 00:04:04,866
and your mom had thrown you out of the house.

87
00:04:05,732 --> 00:04:10,273
You were only tring to kill the baby, isn’t that right?

88
00:04:12,865 --> 00:04:14,793
You thought that if… 

89
00:04:14,793 --> 00:04:18,900
if you could make the baby go away, things would be better.

90
00:04:21,264 --> 00:04:24,199
It’s okay, sweet heart.

91
00:04:24,673 --> 00:04:26,715
I am gonna help you.

92
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,692
But first, I am gonna sent someone in 

93
00:04:29,692 --> 00:04:32,325
to write down the things we talked about.

94
00:04:32,325 --> 00:04:34,342
Then I am gonna help you get out.

95
00:04:35,426 --> 00:04:38,122
I promise.

96
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:49,131
Get her a statement.

97
00:04:53,581 --> 00:04:56,844
听写：诸如

98
00:04:57,271 --> 00:05:01,294
时间轴：美溪客

99
00:05:37,109 --> 00:05:38,975
This is the first trial of this kind 

100
00:05:38,975 --> 00:05:41,159
where a woman is actually being charged 

101
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:43,217
with fornicating her husband to dead.

102
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,593
Gee, she is in every channel.

103
00:05:44,593 --> 00:05:48,565
…she is now accused of inducing his heart attack with sexual intercourse.

104
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:51,008
The defence firm of Donnnel Young Dole $ Frutt…

105
00:05:51,008 --> 00:05:52,656
Hey, I gotta run down to the court house, 

106
00:05:52,656 --> 00:05:54,894
favor for Helen, some homicide case.

107
00:05:54,894 --> 00:05:57,099
Helen asks a favor on a homicide case?

108
00:05:57,099 --> 00:05:58,799
I’ll call you when I know more.

109
00:05:59,665 --> 00:06:02,169
However, in one of the more amusing polls, 

110
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:04,909
33% of the men said they would nevertheless 

111
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:07,257
still want to have sex with the Black Widow 

112
00:06:07,257 --> 00:06:10,079
fully knowing she might then try to kill them.

113
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,207
I would.

114
00:06:14,288 --> 00:06:17,146
32622, Commonwealth versus Jenifer Holbrook,

115
00:06:17,146 --> 00:06:18,460
murder in the first degree.

116
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,643
Ellenor Frutt for the defendant, waive reading,

117
00:06:20,643 --> 00:06:22,125
we enter a plea of not guilty.

118
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,607
Helen Gamble for the Commonwealth, 

119
00:06:23,607 --> 00:06:25,010
You Honour, I’d like to conference, 

120
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,927
I think we can depose of it today.

121
00:06:26,927 --> 00:06:29,060
A first degree murder case?

122
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,540
I’d like to conference.

123
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:32,581
Let’s go.

124
00:06:35,023 --> 00:06:38,711
Jenny, I am Ellenor Frutt, I am your attorney here.

125
00:06:38,711 --> 00:06:40,437
And right now I am gonna go back there 

126
00:06:40,437 --> 00:06:42,728
and I'm gonna talk to the Judge and the District Attorney 

127
00:06:42,728 --> 00:06:44,946
and then I am gonna come back and talk to you, okay?

128
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,379
Okay.

129
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:48,080
Ok, it’s very important that 

130
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,806
you don’t talk to anybody about this, nobody.

131
00:06:51,468 --> 00:06:54,282
All right. I’ll be back in a few minutes.

132
00:07:11,082 --> 00:07:12,941
It’s a prior bad act, inadmissible on the…

133
00:07:12,941 --> 00:07:14,318
It goes to pattern, Your Honour. 

134
00:07:14,318 --> 00:07:16,078
She killed her last husband; she killed this one.

135
00:07:16,078 --> 00:07:18,399
She killed neither, and two cannot make a pattern any way.

136
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,172
She could have killed her first husband as well, 

137
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:21,122
that would make three.

138
00:07:21,122 --> 00:07:23,582
Her first husband died of cancer, what are you saying?

139
00:07:23,582 --> 00:07:24,796
She’s clever.

140
00:07:25,734 --> 00:07:29,713
Settle down. I’ll remove you all if I have to.

141
00:07:29,713 --> 00:07:31,108
Your Honour, my client was never charged 

142
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:33,120
-with the murder of her previous husband -She was and still is a suspect

143
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,532
to allow the prosecution to argue this.

144
00:07:34,532 --> 00:07:36,456
Three marriages; three dead husbands. 

145
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,398
That’s a pattern.

146
00:07:38,953 --> 00:07:40,159
I am going to allow it.

147
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,372
Appealed.

148
00:07:41,372 --> 00:07:42,895
So noted.Anything else?

149
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:43,901
No, Your Honour.

150
00:07:43,901 --> 00:07:45,555
Is the Commonwealth ready for trial?

151
00:07:45,555 --> 00:07:46,443
Ready, Your Honour.

152
00:07:46,443 --> 00:07:47,321
Mr. Donnell?

153
00:07:47,321 --> 00:07:48,097
Ready.

154
00:07:48,097 --> 00:07:49,986
Tow o’clock, till then.

155
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,164
I am not sure that was your ** try.

156
00:07:56,164 --> 00:07:58,522
Just preserving the objection for appeal.

157
00:07:58,522 --> 00:08:01,060
The truth is I want them to introduce this stuff.

158
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,280
Why?

159
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,424
Because it’s been on the papers for months, 

160
00:08:04,424 --> 00:08:06,229
there is no way those jurors haven’t heard of it.

161
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:08,678
We’ll need to address it accordingly.

162
00:08:08,678 --> 00:08:11,478
They’re not calling you black widow because you like bugs.

163
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,251
She was thrown out of the house by her mother, 

164
00:08:17,251 --> 00:08:19,377
she never had a father; she is 15 years old.

165
00:08:19,377 --> 00:08:21,577
I…I just like to do this quietly 

166
00:08:21,577 --> 00:08:22,995
before it become the front page 

167
00:08:22,995 --> 00:08:25,049
of the Metro Session which it would be.

168
00:08:25,049 --> 00:08:26,224
What’s your offer?

169
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,663
I’ll give you involuntary manslaughter, three years.

170
00:08:29,663 --> 00:08:32,407
That way she is out when she’s 18 instead of 21.

171
00:08:32,407 --> 00:08:34,596
She might have a shattered life.

172
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,668
Well, I need to look at her file, I'll talk it over with her.

173
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:38,940
But that sounds great.

174
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,778
Ms. Gamble said she’d help me.

175
00:08:42,778 --> 00:08:44,217
She is, Jenny, trust me.

176
00:08:44,217 --> 00:08:47,272
Involuntary manslaughter is a very good offer 

177
00:08:47,272 --> 00:08:50,021
considering this happened in you third trimester.

178
00:08:50,021 --> 00:08:52,676
You could be out by the time you are 18.

179
00:08:52,676 --> 00:08:55,884
And even if we went to trial and won on diminished capacity, 

180
00:08:55,884 --> 00:08:58,528
you are still looking at as much time.

181
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,857
So I should plead guilty?

182
00:09:01,857 --> 00:09:04,683
Well, first I want you to undergo a psychiatric exam.

183
00:09:04,683 --> 00:09:06,396
Then I'd like to review your statement 

184
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:08,653
in the police report a little more, but… 

185
00:09:10,219 --> 00:09:12,653
yes, it’s an excellent deal

186
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,309
and I think we should jump at it.

187
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:25,470
Has your mom come to see you yet?

188
00:09:26,415 --> 00:09:28,776
I don’t think she even knows.

189
00:09:31,796 --> 00:09:33,832
Could you tell her?

190
00:09:33,832 --> 00:09:34,689
Sure.

191
00:09:36,497 --> 00:09:38,724
I am gonna get Lucy Hatcher, my assistant 

192
00:09:38,724 --> 00:09:39,687
to come in and talk to you. 

193
00:09:39,687 --> 00:09:43,389
We are gonna need to get you some new clothes for court, okay? 

194
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:44,706
All right.

195
00:09:46,911 --> 00:09:48,626
I am gonna be in touch.

196
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:05,818
And were you able to determine the cause of death, Doctor?

197
00:10:05,818 --> 00:10:07,940
Acute cardiac arrest.

198
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,365
You did toxicology tests?

199
00:10:09,365 --> 00:10:10,217
We did.

200
00:10:10,217 --> 00:10:12,061
Anything remarkable on those tests?

201
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:15,392
We found traces of the drug commonly known as Viagra.

202
00:10:15,392 --> 00:10:18,945
I never ever prescript Viagra for Jerry.

203
00:10:18,945 --> 00:10:20,934
Did you ever talk about Viagra with him?

204
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:22,051
Yes, we did.

205
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:24,484
And I told him on no uncertain terms 

206
00:10:24,484 --> 00:10:27,348
taking that drug would be a death sentence.

207
00:10:27,348 --> 00:10:28,747
Why is that, doctor?

208
00:10:28,747 --> 00:10:30,208
Jerry had a weak heart. 

209
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:33,783
He'd gone through two separate by pass operations.

210
00:10:33,783 --> 00:10:35,536
The very last thing he should had been taken 

211
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:38,594
is a pill to facilitate sexual marathons.

212
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:41,642
The reason you were talking about Viagra with Jerry Hanson 

213
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:42,968
is because he wanted it,

214
00:10:42,968 --> 00:10:44,088
isn’t that right, doctor?

215
00:10:44,088 --> 00:10:45,134
-Yes, but I…  -Thank you.

216
00:10:45,134 --> 00:10:47,621
And in addition to being jerry Hanson’s doctor, 

217
00:10:47,621 --> 00:10:49,028
were you also his friend?

218
00:10:49,028 --> 00:10:50,287
Yes, I was.

219
00:10:50,287 --> 00:10:52,062
His death was very upsetting for you?

220
00:10:52,062 --> 00:10:53,735
Do they teach that in law school? 

221
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:55,891
It's upsetting when friends die?

222
00:10:55,891 --> 00:10:56,889
Doctor.

223
00:10:57,016 --> 00:10:58,809
Of course I am upset.

224
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:01,573
And if you believe my client was responsible for his death, 

225
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:03,389
you wanna see her convicted, wouldn’t you?

226
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:04,088
Objection!

227
00:11:04,088 --> 00:11:04,929
Goes to bias.

228
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:06,531
You’ve made the point, move on.

229
00:11:07,323 --> 00:11:11,634
Doctor, you said Jerry wanted to perform better with my client.

230
00:11:11,634 --> 00:11:12,282
Yes.

231
00:11:12,282 --> 00:11:13,585
Sexually perform?

232
00:11:13,585 --> 00:11:15,858
Yes, sexually perform.

233
00:11:15,858 --> 00:11:19,894
She wanted him to perform better and he wanted to perform better.

234
00:11:19,894 --> 00:11:23,687
She played these mind games with him, made him feel inadequate.

235
00:11:23,687 --> 00:11:25,130
Well, if he were feeling inadequate, 

236
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,836
could that be why he wanted the Viagra?

237
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:27,917
Possibly.But I…

238
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:28,967
And you wouldn’t give it to him. 

239
00:11:28,967 --> 00:11:30,986
You made no room for the possibility,

240
00:11:30,986 --> 00:11:32,888
that he might go get it someplace else.

241
00:11:32,888 --> 00:11:35,173
Well, why was it ground up and put into wine?

242
00:11:35,173 --> 00:11:36,255
Move to strike.

243
00:11:36,255 --> 00:11:37,301
If he want to take it…

244
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:37,958
Move to strike.

245
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,210
-She laced the wine and killed him.  -Move to strike.

246
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,644
That’s enough.

247
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:47,275
Doctor, did you advised Jerry Hanson 

248
00:11:47,275 --> 00:11:50,336
to refrain from sexual intercourse altogether?

249
00:11:50,336 --> 00:11:54,624
No, I told him to be very careful and take it slow.

250
00:11:54,624 --> 00:11:56,561
Oh then, why couldn’t he take the drug 

251
00:11:56,561 --> 00:12:00,370
just to help him perform but carefully and slowly?

252
00:12:01,102 --> 00:12:04,930
People with heart conditions do use this drug sometimes, 

253
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:05,865
isn’t it right, doctor?

254
00:12:05,865 --> 00:12:09,077
Yes, but I didn’t think it was indicated for Jerry.

255
00:12:09,077 --> 00:12:09,957
Why not?

256
00:12:09,957 --> 00:12:14,589
Because knowing Jerry, I was afraid he would try to keep up with her.

257
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:18,585
And add Viagra, his heart might give out before…

258
00:12:18,585 --> 00:12:22,185
And knowing Jerry’s nature, he wouldn't have the sense to stop, 

259
00:12:22,185 --> 00:12:23,307
was that your fear?

260
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:24,147
Yes.

261
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:26,563
Thank you, doctor.

262
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:33,875
Ms. Holbrook?

263
00:12:33,982 --> 00:12:34,755
Yeah.

264
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,742
My name is Ellenor Frutt, I am an attorney.

265
00:12:36,742 --> 00:12:38,482
What do you want?

266
00:12:38,482 --> 00:12:40,230
I am afraid I have some bad news.

267
00:12:41,652 --> 00:12:42,720
She dead?

268
00:12:43,236 --> 00:12:44,164
Who?

269
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:45,264
Jenny.

270
00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:47,940
Oh, no, no no no, she’s not dead. 

271
00:12:48,672 --> 00:12:51,506
But her baby is, and she has been charged with its death.

272
00:12:51,506 --> 00:12:53,925
She’s in custody now and I am representing her.

273
00:12:53,925 --> 00:12:55,622
What’s gonna happen to her?

274
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,834
Well, she may have to go to a juvenile detention centre until she’s 18, 

275
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:01,519
that’s what we are hoping for.

276
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,074
Three years, a baby lasts a lot longer than that, 

277
00:13:06,074 --> 00:13:07,644
she made out good.

278
00:13:09,974 --> 00:13:11,198
Yeah.

279
00:13:21,002 --> 00:13:22,254
We tested the wine, 

280
00:13:22,254 --> 00:13:25,725
the results indicated there were remnants of Viagra in it.

281
00:13:25,725 --> 00:13:29,037
And what, if any, conclusions did you draw from this, detective?

282
00:13:29,037 --> 00:13:32,344
That the Viagra had been grounded up and put into the wine.

283
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:35,738
Her previous husband, Mr. Carter, died of an insulin overdoes.

284
00:13:35,738 --> 00:13:37,206
Accidental?

285
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:40,014
There was evidence of the report that he was killed by the defendant, 

286
00:13:40,014 --> 00:13:41,906
who was still married to him at the time.

287
00:13:41,906 --> 00:13:42,878
What evidence?

288
00:13:42,878 --> 00:13:46,358
He was a diabetic, he gave himself insulin injections daily 

289
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:49,656
and had been for years without incident.

290
00:13:49,656 --> 00:13:52,209
And here we had a massive overdose.

291
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:53,260
It was hard for us to believe 

292
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,516
that he could have made such a huge mistake.

293
00:13:55,516 --> 00:13:59,218
Laden fingerprints on the syringe match the defendant.

294
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:02,263
She inherited under the will which gave financial motive.

295
00:14:02,263 --> 00:14:05,654
You never charged Mrs. Hansen with Mr. Carter’s death.

296
00:14:05,654 --> 00:14:08,358
No, we were never able to collect enough evidence.

297
00:14:08,358 --> 00:14:10,976
In fact, the truth is you had no evidence, 

298
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:13,326
other than your suspicion, isn’t that right, Detective?

299
00:14:13,326 --> 00:14:14,671
Her prints were on the syringe.

300
00:14:14,671 --> 00:14:18,631
She could have handed him the syringe like she said, possible?

301
00:14:19,446 --> 00:14:20,736
Possible.

302
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:23,476
We are missing something.

303
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:24,436
Why?

304
00:14:24,436 --> 00:14:26,606
Their case is lousy.

305
00:14:26,606 --> 00:14:28,745
It’s all circumstantial and innuendo, 

306
00:14:28,745 --> 00:14:31,067
Marcia Scott is a smart DA.

307
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:33,259
and she hasn’t put anything on the table.

308
00:14:34,028 --> 00:14:35,764
We are missing something.

309
00:14:37,736 --> 00:14:39,903
Courtney, 

310
00:14:42,035 --> 00:14:43,105
are we?

311
00:14:43,105 --> 00:14:44,628
No. I mean…

312
00:14:44,628 --> 00:14:46,083
What’s his son gonna say?

313
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,423
Just what we talked about.

314
00:14:47,423 --> 00:14:49,481
But he’s had an agenda from the beginning; 

315
00:14:49,481 --> 00:14:52,728
he never even wanted me to marry his father in the first place.

316
00:14:52,728 --> 00:14:53,709
Why?

317
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,421
He was afraid I’d kill him.

318
00:14:56,421 --> 00:15:00,213
Because of all the suspicion around my previous husbands’ death.

319
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:03,858
Well, they must think he as some kind of witness 

320
00:15:03,858 --> 00:15:06,312
because they’re resting on his testimony.

321
00:15:06,312 --> 00:15:09,318
We’re missing something.

322
00:15:09,318 --> 00:15:11,754
They could rest by midday tomorrow, so, 

323
00:15:11,754 --> 00:15:13,606
let’s go over your testimony.

324
00:15:13,606 --> 00:15:14,784
I go first?

325
00:15:14,784 --> 00:15:17,804
You’re first and last, you’re all we have.

326
00:15:24,684 --> 00:15:26,002
How did it go?

327
00:15:26,752 --> 00:15:27,778
All right.

328
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:29,197
Did you tell her mother?

329
00:15:29,197 --> 00:15:30,774
Yeah. You know what she said?

330
00:15:30,774 --> 00:15:31,753
Three years, not too bad, 

331
00:15:31,753 --> 00:15:33,691
a baby last longer than three years.

332
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:38,823
Ellenor, Helen told her she could leave.

333
00:15:38,823 --> 00:15:40,779
She also told Jenny about her own abortion 

334
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:42,772
and how she needed to talk about it.

335
00:15:44,366 --> 00:15:46,644
I think she was tricked into that confession.

336
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,988
She told you she had an abortion?

337
00:15:51,988 --> 00:15:52,722
Yes.

338
00:15:52,722 --> 00:15:53,994
And what else?

339
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,847
Just so hard it was for her

340
00:15:55,847 --> 00:15:58,661
and how she made it worse by keeping it all inside.

341
00:15:58,661 --> 00:16:02,091
She said it would be better for me to tell her 

342
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:05,005
and that if I did, she’d make sure I could leave jail.

343
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:05,947
What else?

344
00:16:05,947 --> 00:16:07,757
She just kept saying how you know,

345
00:16:07,757 --> 00:16:10,847
she understood how I would want to make the baby go away, 

346
00:16:11,632 --> 00:16:14,617
and how my life…

347
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,240
I thought she’d help me.

348
00:16:18,215 --> 00:16:21,262
She never said I would be convicted of murder, 

349
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,655
she never said that.

350
00:16:35,118 --> 00:16:38,295
My first husband? How was he relevant?

351
00:16:38,295 --> 00:16:40,171
Well, we have to cover the old thing.

352
00:16:41,023 --> 00:16:43,409
All your husbands were years older, 

353
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:46,523
it’s a question the jury will be asking and I'd like to answer it.

354
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:51,823
It’s not something I really want to get into on the witness stand 

355
00:16:51,823 --> 00:16:53,809
in front of a roomful of reporters.

356
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:55,222
Well, get into it now, 

357
00:16:55,822 --> 00:16:57,838
I’ll decide whether it's useful or not.

358
00:17:01,847 --> 00:17:03,820
I…er… 

359
00:17:04,576 --> 00:17:07,033
began to develop when I was 11.

360
00:17:07,781 --> 00:17:09,735
My older brother’s friends were copping feels 

361
00:17:09,735 --> 00:17:11,309
by the time when I was 12.

362
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:13,861
When I was 15 college guys were hitting on me.

363
00:17:13,861 --> 00:17:16,603
Even now, your colleague, Mr. Berluti, 

364
00:17:18,431 --> 00:17:20,632
and even you…

365
00:17:21,691 --> 00:17:24,057
have your thoughts.

366
00:17:25,285 --> 00:17:27,940
Me? Wh..wh..what have I done?

367
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,943
It’s beside the point.

368
00:17:28,943 --> 00:17:30,637
The point is 

369
00:17:31,255 --> 00:17:35,636
I’ve been on my guard with men my whole life.

370
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:39,875
The only man I ever felt safe with growing up was my dad.

371
00:17:40,683 --> 00:17:44,011
So, I suppose on some level, 

372
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:49,459
my attraction to older men is more about 

373
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,485
I’ve been drown to the safety of…

374
00:17:55,981 --> 00:17:57,649
I don’t know.

375
00:17:57,649 --> 00:18:01,394
I...I hope that you don’t feel that I’ve been…

376
00:18:01,394 --> 00:18:03,690
You’ve been nothing but totally professional.

377
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,982
But I know when a man is attracted to me, 

378
00:18:06,982 --> 00:18:10,106
sometimes is even before he does.

379
00:18:14,478 --> 00:18:15,612
Ellenor, you didn’t tell her?

380
00:18:15,612 --> 00:18:17,140
I don’t wanna her prepared.

381
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,153
32622, Commonwealth versus Jenifer Holbrook, 

382
00:18:20,153 --> 00:18:21,457
Murder in the first degree.

383
00:18:22,263 --> 00:18:24,656
Your Honour, both parties offer joint recommendation 

384
00:18:24,656 --> 00:18:26,171
as we discussed in conference. 

385
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:26,874
I am sure Ms. Holbrook…

386
00:18:26,874 --> 00:18:29,423
Actually, Your Honour, defence rescinds such agreement on the plea, 

387
00:18:29,423 --> 00:18:32,310
and instead brings a motion to suppress Ms. Holbrook’s confession.

388
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,722
Ellenor.

389
00:18:32,722 --> 00:18:33,788
On what grounds?

390
00:18:33,788 --> 00:18:36,231
My client’s statement was a result of coercion 

391
00:18:36,231 --> 00:18:39,025
and was also obtained by violation of Fifth Amendment Rights.

392
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:39,975
What are you talking about?

393
00:18:39,975 --> 00:18:41,654
Miranda, my client didn’t understand...

394
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,444
She was read her rights twice.

395
00:18:43,444 --> 00:18:45,640
And then she was basically unread them, Helen.

396
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,417
What?

397
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,719
What’s going on here?

398
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:50,689
Ms. Gamble told my client that if she gave her a statement 

399
00:18:50,689 --> 00:18:51,943
she would get to leave.

400
00:18:51,943 --> 00:18:53,001
Basically, Your Honour, 

401
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:56,215
where Miranda says anything you say maybe used against you, 

402
00:18:56,215 --> 00:19:00,355
Ms. Gamble told her anything you say maybe used to help you.

403
00:19:00,355 --> 00:19:02,195
Ms. Holbrook is 15 years old, 

404
00:19:02,195 --> 00:19:04,872
still in the thrills of a pretty big emotional wallop, 

405
00:19:04,872 --> 00:19:06,969
and she believed the promises Ms. Gamble made.

406
00:19:06,969 --> 00:19:07,982
Oh, come on.

407
00:19:07,982 --> 00:19:09,553
Have you ever had an abortion?

408
00:19:10,308 --> 00:19:13,852
She talked to my client about her very own abortion, 

409
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:16,861
in order to get Jenny to admit that she killed her unborn child.

410
00:19:16,861 --> 00:19:19,447
The only thing that matters for the purpose of a confession 

411
00:19:19,447 --> 00:19:21,370
is was the suspect read her rights 

412
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,535
and did she make the statement voluntarily.

413
00:19:23,535 --> 00:19:25,433
She was, she did.

414
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:28,468
And I contend she was confused in respect to her right, 

415
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:31,631
deliberately confused and that the statement was not voluntary.

416
00:19:31,631 --> 00:19:32,474
All right.

417
00:19:34,418 --> 00:19:37,394
I would like to see Ms. Holbrook in chambers please.

418
00:19:37,394 --> 00:19:38,108
Excuse me?

419
00:19:38,832 --> 00:19:42,876
You have a problem with me asking a few questions, Counsel?

420
00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:45,905
Nice ambush, Ellenor.

421
00:19:45,905 --> 00:19:48,307
You know, don’t talk to me about ambush, Helen, you used me.

422
00:19:48,307 --> 00:19:49,631
I did no such thing.

423
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,958
You figured I’d be less inclined to doubt your motives, 

424
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:52,645
I don’t like it.

425
00:19:52,645 --> 00:19:54,526
My motive was to help that girl.

426
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,272
And what was it when you went into that room to interrogate her?

427
00:19:56,272 --> 00:19:59,021
To get her statement. Having got a confession 

428
00:19:59,021 --> 00:20:00,597
I did have compassion for her.

429
00:20:00,597 --> 00:20:01,936
That is why I came to you.

430
00:20:01,936 --> 00:20:04,923
I don’t know how in good conscious you could trick a 15-year-old…

431
00:20:04,923 --> 00:20:07,041
Your client is a murderer, Ellenor.

432
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,795
You are angry, I understand. 

433
00:20:08,795 --> 00:20:11,240
But don’t appeal to me on conscious.

434
00:20:14,158 --> 00:20:16,639
I was suspicious of her from the very beginning.

435
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:18,407
Why was that?

436
00:20:18,407 --> 00:20:21,885
My father was in his 70’s, frail.

437
00:20:21,885 --> 00:20:24,479
He wasn’t what anybody would call attractive, 

438
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:26,060
nor was he at all charming. 

439
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,860
And she falls in love with him?

440
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,764
Did your father ever talk to you 

441
00:20:29,764 --> 00:20:31,797
about his relationship with the defendant?

442
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:32,988
Sometimes.

443
00:20:32,988 --> 00:20:35,542
Specifically, what did he talk about?

444
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:37,185
Specifically, sex. 

445
00:20:37,185 --> 00:20:39,254
He said she was insatiable.

446
00:20:39,254 --> 00:20:40,310
He once said…

447
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,408
Objection, hearsay.

448
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:44,754
Did he ever seem upset when he spoke of sex?

449
00:20:44,754 --> 00:20:46,627
Once he was excited, yes.

450
00:20:46,627 --> 00:20:47,560
What did he say then?

451
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,417
Objection!

452
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:50,491
Excited utterance, exception of the hearsay rule.

453
00:20:50,491 --> 00:20:52,764
And he just happened to use that word “excited”? 

454
00:20:52,764 --> 00:20:54,196
This witness has been coached.

455
00:20:54,196 --> 00:20:55,443
I object to that.

456
00:20:55,443 --> 00:20:56,388
All right.

457
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:00,579
Mr. Donnell, your objection is overruled. Please sit. 

458
00:21:00,579 --> 00:21:02,437
The witness may answer the question.

459
00:21:02,437 --> 00:21:05,278
What did your father tell you, Mr. Hansen?

460
00:21:05,278 --> 00:21:08,980
He said she would make love so physically sometimes, 

461
00:21:09,815 --> 00:21:13,216
it was violent, almost sadistic.

462
00:21:13,216 --> 00:21:16,511
He wondered whether she was trying to give him a heart attack.

463
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:19,321
What else, sir?

464
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:23,303
He said she taunted him during sex, 

465
00:21:23,303 --> 00:21:29,694
taunted him to go harder, like some weird psychological punishment.

466
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,545
I have nothing further, Your Honour.

467
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:41,875
Did she say I am going to put Viagra in his wine 

468
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,561
and then make love to him till he suffers a coronary,

469
00:21:44,561 --> 00:21:46,742
coz that would be good testimony, Mr. Hansen. 

470
00:21:46,742 --> 00:21:48,071
Maybe you should have her say that.

471
00:21:48,071 --> 00:21:48,863
Objection!

472
00:21:48,863 --> 00:21:49,845
Withdrawn.

473
00:21:50,573 --> 00:21:52,887
Did your father feel his life was in danger?

474
00:21:52,887 --> 00:21:54,448
Well, I think a little he did.

475
00:21:54,448 --> 00:21:56,137
Did you take him seriously?

476
00:21:56,137 --> 00:21:56,937
Yes.

477
00:21:56,937 --> 00:22:00,328
Did you notify the police, talk to my client, express your concern?

478
00:22:00,328 --> 00:22:01,426
No.

479
00:22:01,426 --> 00:22:03,073
So you weren’t concerned. 

480
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:05,542
You took the danger seriously, but it didn’t concern you?

481
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:06,885
What was I supposed to do? 

482
00:22:06,885 --> 00:22:07,980
Go to the police and say: 

483
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:12,683
Hey, I think my step-mother is trying to intercourse my farther to death?

484
00:22:12,683 --> 00:22:15,300
If you were concerned, yes.

485
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,949
Tell me, Mr. Hansen, 

486
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:19,251
If my client is convicted of murder, 

487
00:22:19,251 --> 00:22:21,851
and becomes disqualifid from the inheritence 

488
00:22:21,851 --> 00:22:23,822
who then takes under the will?

489
00:22:23,822 --> 00:22:24,947
That would be me.

490
00:22:24,947 --> 00:22:26,235
That would be you.

491
00:22:26,235 --> 00:22:29,117
Do you think I am sitting in this chair today because of money?

492
00:22:29,117 --> 00:22:30,223
That’s exactly what I think.

493
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,377
I think you are a liar, 

494
00:22:31,377 --> 00:22:31,740
Objection.

495
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,913
I think your testimony was false, calculated.

496
00:22:33,913 --> 00:22:34,447
Objection!

497
00:22:34,447 --> 00:22:35,970
Are you lying to get your father’s money?

498
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:36,843
Counsel.

499
00:22:36,843 --> 00:22:39,207
It’s just a little too damn convenient for me, I am sorry.

500
00:22:39,207 --> 00:22:42,049
My client is being charged with murder for inducing a heart attack, 

501
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:43,468
and you get up here and say: 

502
00:22:43,468 --> 00:22:46,907
Gee, my farther told me he was afraid she’d give him a heart attack

503
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,587
when you never said that to anybody before, Mr. Hansen.

504
00:22:49,587 --> 00:22:52,115
And you remember to add he was excited when he said it 

505
00:22:52,115 --> 00:22:53,860
to get around the hearsay rule, 

506
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,323
well, probably at the District Attorney’s coaching.

507
00:22:56,323 --> 00:22:56,934
Objection!

508
00:22:56,934 --> 00:22:58,263
It’s just a little too convenient.

509
00:22:58,263 --> 00:22:59,224
He’s badgering.

510
00:22:59,224 --> 00:23:01,119
Damn right I am; I badger liars.

511
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,504
Mr. Young, that’s enough.

512
00:23:03,351 --> 00:23:05,408
You said she makes love in a violent way.

513
00:23:05,408 --> 00:23:07,017
That’s what he said, she…

514
00:23:07,017 --> 00:23:09,102
What’s violent to a 70-year-old man?

515
00:23:09,102 --> 00:23:09,970
I don’t know.

516
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,043
Well, did you ask?

517
00:23:12,051 --> 00:23:13,667
Your father says violent,

518
00:23:13,667 --> 00:23:14,743
you don’t follow that up and say: 

519
00:23:14,743 --> 00:23:16,032
Dad, what do you mean?

520
00:23:16,032 --> 00:23:17,442
I wish I had.

521
00:23:17,442 --> 00:23:20,321
You said she taunts, she’s sadistic, 

522
00:23:20,321 --> 00:23:22,297
she psychologically punishes him, 

523
00:23:22,297 --> 00:23:24,745
and you don’t even go to her and say what’s going on?

524
00:23:24,745 --> 00:23:26,872
What kind of caring son are you?

525
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,090
Maybe I should have done…

526
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,891
-Do you know what perjuries is, Craig?  -Objection!

527
00:23:29,891 --> 00:23:31,237
You are under oath here.

528
00:23:31,237 --> 00:23:32,845
Mr. Young.

529
00:23:37,061 --> 00:23:38,478
I am done.

530
00:23:48,778 --> 00:23:51,604
And since, you know, she was an attorney, 

531
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:53,547
I thought…

532
00:23:53,547 --> 00:23:56,524
I thought she would make it so I could leave.

533
00:23:56,524 --> 00:23:58,942
But when you signed this statement?

534
00:23:58,942 --> 00:24:03,045
She said that if I told them exactly what happened 

535
00:24:03,045 --> 00:24:07,656
it would be better for me by not keeping stuff inside, 

536
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:08,059
and I…

537
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:10,871
She told you she had an abortion?

538
00:24:10,871 --> 00:24:12,049
Yes. 

539
00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:13,713
And how terrible it was for her 

540
00:24:13,713 --> 00:24:16,209
that she kept stuff buried inside and…

541
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:19,900
You lied to me.

542
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,390
I trusted you and you lied to me.

543
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,716
All right, Jenny, 

544
00:24:23,716 --> 00:24:26,891
the detectives told you, did they not, 

545
00:24:26,891 --> 00:24:31,833
that the things you said cold be used against you in a court of law.

546
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:33,368
Yes. 

547
00:24:34,132 --> 00:24:36,964
But then she came in and she is an attorney, 

548
00:24:36,964 --> 00:24:39,087
and she said they wouldn’t be.

549
00:24:43,825 --> 00:24:47,850
Jenny, I think I'd like you to wait outside for a minute.

550
00:24:51,821 --> 00:24:53,964
Keep her here please.

551
00:24:58,687 --> 00:25:01,255
Aren’t we resourceful?

552
00:25:01,255 --> 00:25:03,345
None of her civil rights were violated.

553
00:25:03,345 --> 00:25:04,905
Did you have an abortion?

554
00:25:07,025 --> 00:25:10,531
No. Tricks are used in interrogations all the time.

555
00:25:10,531 --> 00:25:11,618
This was a lie.

556
00:25:11,618 --> 00:25:13,026
Lies too.

557
00:25:13,818 --> 00:25:17,399
There is nothing unconstitutional about lying to a suspect 

558
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:20,033
so long as they understand their rights, 

559
00:25:20,033 --> 00:25:20,927
which she did.

560
00:25:20,927 --> 00:25:23,425
I disagree with that, she didn’t understand her rights.

561
00:25:23,425 --> 00:25:24,262
Oh, come on, 

562
00:25:24,262 --> 00:25:26,945
look, we can all try to get inside this girl’s head 

563
00:25:26,945 --> 00:25:29,069
but that’s not the way it goes.

564
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,955
We have constitutional dos and don’ts, 

565
00:25:30,955 --> 00:25:32,972
we didn’t commit any of the don’ts.

566
00:25:32,972 --> 00:25:35,528
The statement is valid and admissible.

567
00:25:35,528 --> 00:25:37,114
That’s my decision.

568
00:25:37,843 --> 00:25:40,131
I am going to think about it.

569
00:25:44,198 --> 00:25:47,039
We'll reconvene at 2 o’clock.

570
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,566
May I say something?

571
00:25:50,913 --> 00:25:53,754
You’re all thinking about Jenny Holbrook.

572
00:25:53,754 --> 00:25:56,882
I wasn’t called in to talk to Jenny Holbrook.

573
00:25:56,882 --> 00:26:00,622
I was brought down to question a murder suspect, 

574
00:26:00,622 --> 00:26:02,158
a suspect who killed a baby, 

575
00:26:02,158 --> 00:26:04,991
a suspect who wouldn't talk to the police.

576
00:26:04,991 --> 00:26:09,836
Now, the morality of how I tricked her has no relevance.

577
00:26:09,836 --> 00:26:12,894
This isn’t a moral arena, it is a legal one.

578
00:26:12,894 --> 00:26:14,677
And everything I did was legal, 

579
00:26:14,677 --> 00:26:16,831
and she has this back story, 

580
00:26:16,831 --> 00:26:20,391
and a fragile personality, and abusive mother, 

581
00:26:20,391 --> 00:26:22,872
it all seems just so awful now.

582
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:26,231
Here’s a flash, killers don’t like to talk.

583
00:26:26,231 --> 00:26:29,208
It’s not easy getting these confessions.

584
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:33,638
Tag a bunch of moral strings now on top of the constitutional ones, 

585
00:26:33,638 --> 00:26:35,932
we will never get anybody.

586
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:50,976
He brought the Viagra.

587
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:51,582
Your husband did?

588
00:26:51,582 --> 00:26:52,479
Yes.

589
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:54,229
Did he say where he'd gotten it?

590
00:26:54,229 --> 00:26:54,958
No.

591
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:56,662
And then you put it in the wine?

592
00:26:56,662 --> 00:26:57,477
Yes. 

593
00:26:57,477 --> 00:27:00,382
He had 50 milligrams one pill and 

594
00:27:00,382 --> 00:27:03,614
well, we were talking about the fact that it was now been reported 

595
00:27:03,614 --> 00:27:06,284
that women got benefits from taking it too, so 

596
00:27:06,284 --> 00:27:09,524
more for a laugh than anything else, we ground up the pill, 

597
00:27:09,524 --> 00:27:11,443
and we sprinkled it into our wine.

598
00:27:11,443 --> 00:27:12,543
And then?

599
00:27:12,543 --> 00:27:16,158
After dinner, we watched some television then we went to bed, 

600
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,721
and we made love.

601
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:20,889
And the effects of the Viagra?

602
00:27:21,748 --> 00:27:24,501
Well, it definitely works.

603
00:27:24,501 --> 00:27:26,644
And at some point?

604
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:28,846
Jerry gripped his chest. 

605
00:27:28,846 --> 00:27:31,334
He was having a heart attack.

606
00:27:31,334 --> 00:27:34,942
I called 911 before I am CPR, 

607
00:27:34,942 --> 00:27:37,684
but by the time the paramedics got there, 

608
00:27:37,684 --> 00:27:39,783
he was gone.

609
00:27:41,024 --> 00:27:45,177
There’s been testimony that you were extremely physical, 

610
00:27:45,177 --> 00:27:46,056
and that you taunted…

611
00:27:46,056 --> 00:27:48,880
That’s completely false. Craig Hansen was lying, 

612
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,161
his father never said those things to him.

613
00:27:51,161 --> 00:27:53,826
Our love making was never very physical, 

614
00:27:53,826 --> 00:27:55,711
it was certainly not violent.

615
00:27:55,711 --> 00:27:59,386
My husband had a heart condition and we were always mindful of it, 

616
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,698
both of us.

617
00:28:00,698 --> 00:28:03,500
You say your husband brought the Viagra?

618
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,715
That’s right.

619
00:28:04,715 --> 00:28:07,205
Did you ever get Viagra from your Doctor?

620
00:28:07,205 --> 00:28:08,106
No.

621
00:28:08,106 --> 00:28:11,332
Ever talked to her about the virtues of Viagra for women?

622
00:28:11,332 --> 00:28:13,434
Well, yes, we had discussed that.

623
00:28:13,434 --> 00:28:17,034
Okay. I have nothing further, Your Honour.

624
00:28:20,262 --> 00:28:21,349
Counsel.

625
00:28:22,095 --> 00:28:24,513
The witness may step down.

626
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,436
Mr. Donnell.

627
00:28:28,997 --> 00:28:30,347
The defence rest, Your Honour.

628
00:28:30,347 --> 00:28:34,076
The Commonwealth calsl one rebuttal witness, Doctor Gail Parrent.

629
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:34,901
Who is she?

630
00:28:37,368 --> 00:28:40,972
She’s my doctor.

631
00:28:43,645 --> 00:28:46,736
Defence object, Your Honour, side bar.

632
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:54,116
This is my client’s own doctor.

633
00:28:54,116 --> 00:28:56,161
What’s your offer of prove?

634
00:28:56,161 --> 00:28:59,278
She’s prepared to testify she gave the defendant Viagra samples 

635
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:01,539
two days before Jerry Hansen died.

636
00:29:12,199 --> 00:29:16,244
-It’s privileged doctor-patient relationship. -She waived privilege, she opened the door.

637
00:29:16,244 --> 00:29:16,964
How?

638
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:19,408
During her testimony, she had the right to assert privilege, 

639
00:29:19,408 --> 00:29:21,381
she didn’t, she talked about her doctor when I asked…

640
00:29:21,381 --> 00:29:22,530
That is so bogus.

641
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:25,579
You can’t selectively assert privilege, Your Honour,

642
00:29:25,579 --> 00:29:27,597
the woman did answer questions about things 

643
00:29:27,597 --> 00:29:29,182
she discussed with her physician.

644
00:29:29,182 --> 00:29:30,133
I am going to allow it.

645
00:29:30,133 --> 00:29:31,535
You gotta be kidding me.

646
00:29:31,535 --> 00:29:33,214
She opened the door.

647
00:29:38,289 --> 00:29:41,707
I knew we’ve missing something. That was the ace.

648
00:29:47,268 --> 00:29:49,244
You got the Viagra from your own doctor?

649
00:29:49,244 --> 00:29:52,654
I was afraid of how it would look if…

650
00:29:52,654 --> 00:29:55,592
People would think that I secretly put it in his wine.

651
00:29:55,592 --> 00:29:56,401
Did you?

652
00:29:56,401 --> 00:29:58,959
No, it happened exactly as I said.

653
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:00,521
It didn’t happen as you said.

654
00:30:00,521 --> 00:30:03,390
You got the Viagra and now they caught you in a lie.

655
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:06,121
Our whole case was your testimony, your credibility,

656
00:30:06,121 --> 00:30:07,130
and now it's shut

657
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:08,060
Don’t yell at me.

658
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,686
You lied to us, Courtney.

659
00:30:09,686 --> 00:30:13,360
I didn’t kill him, we were making love, I didn’t kill him.

660
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,874
Well, that’s how it looks.

661
00:30:21,865 --> 00:30:23,657
After your doctor testifies,

662
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:29,372
you have to get back up there and explain to the jury why you lied.

663
00:30:31,637 --> 00:30:33,607
And I hope you're good.

664
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:45,569
I was just so afraid of how it would look.

665
00:30:45,569 --> 00:30:48,321
Everybody thinks that I killed my last husband, 

666
00:30:48,321 --> 00:30:51,481
I was afraid if they knew that I was the one who procured the Viagra…

667
00:30:52,713 --> 00:30:54,257
So you lied.

668
00:30:54,257 --> 00:30:55,276
Yes. 

669
00:30:55,276 --> 00:30:59,538
But we both agreed to put it into the wine.

670
00:31:00,684 --> 00:31:04,642
Courtney, why should the jury believe you now?

671
00:31:04,642 --> 00:31:07,026
I don’t have an answer to that, I am…

672
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:11,760
Why should anybody believe that I could fall in love with an older man?

673
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,266
But I did.

674
00:31:15,998 --> 00:31:18,346
I did.

675
00:31:19,537 --> 00:31:22,183
Let’s talk about that.

676
00:31:22,183 --> 00:31:25,459
You’ve fallen in love three older men.

677
00:31:25,459 --> 00:31:28,789
For whatever reason, I found safety in older men.

678
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:31,870
They are not as predatory I suppose.

679
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:35,255
I was telling Mr. Donnell that it probably goes to the safety 

680
00:31:35,255 --> 00:31:36,952
that I found with my own father.

681
00:31:37,953 --> 00:31:40,442
You felt safe with your dad?

682
00:31:42,404 --> 00:31:48,175
Your dad died serving time in Carderit prison in New jersey, didn’t he?

683
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:55,746
He was convicted of raping you when you were nine years old.

684
00:31:55,746 --> 00:31:58,434
He was wrongly convicted.

685
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:01,547
It never happened.

686
00:32:01,547 --> 00:32:07,821
Your mother and your sister walked in on it, Mrs. Hansen?

687
00:32:07,821 --> 00:32:09,245
It never happened.

688
00:32:09,245 --> 00:32:11,533
Your Honour, could I have time to confer with my client?

689
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:13,141
No, you may not.

690
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:18,014
You don’t find safety with these older men, do you, Mrs. Hansen?

691
00:32:18,014 --> 00:32:20,708
You find your anger, your hatred.

692
00:32:21,686 --> 00:32:24,615
He was wrongly convicted, 

693
00:32:25,167 --> 00:32:27,461
it never happened.

694
00:32:46,761 --> 00:32:50,434
So, Courtney, any other surprises?

695
00:32:53,902 --> 00:32:55,568
Never happened.

696
00:33:14,622 --> 00:33:16,014
Be seated.

697
00:33:17,774 --> 00:33:20,895
Well, Ms. Gamble, you are completely right, 

698
00:33:20,895 --> 00:33:23,677
there is nothing illegal or unconstitutional 

699
00:33:23,677 --> 00:33:27,288
about deceiving suspects into giving statements, 

700
00:33:27,288 --> 00:33:28,970
it’s been done all the time.

701
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:32,070
But still, I can’t help but think 

702
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,838
that somehow we’ve lost our way.

703
00:33:34,838 --> 00:33:37,763
The whole point of our constitutional safeguard 

704
00:33:37,763 --> 00:33:42,226
is to protect the suspect against police misconduct.

705
00:33:42,226 --> 00:33:44,925
Maybe you’re on the letter of the law here, 

706
00:33:44,925 --> 00:33:47,230
but the spirit of it took a beating.

707
00:33:48,182 --> 00:33:50,424
Defence counsel’s argument that 

708
00:33:50,424 --> 00:33:54,249
the Miranda suspect was in affect de-Mirandazed 

709
00:33:54,249 --> 00:33:55,858
it's a valid one.

710
00:33:55,858 --> 00:33:58,003
She is 15.

711
00:33:58,003 --> 00:33:59,741
By the time you got through with her,

712
00:33:59,741 --> 00:34:02,653
she believed she'd help herself by talking, 

713
00:34:02,653 --> 00:34:04,753
it doesn’t make sense that 

714
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:07,695
you could read somebody her rights so she'll understand 

715
00:34:07,695 --> 00:34:10,022
only then to deliberately confuse her 

716
00:34:10,022 --> 00:34:13,406
and smile with a constitutional wink.

717
00:34:13,406 --> 00:34:16,520
It would seem that the player in our system 

718
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,634
should at least act in good faith.

719
00:34:22,452 --> 00:34:27,292
But as a judge, I'm bound by precedent 

720
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:31,989
and trickery still survives any constitutional challenge.

721
00:34:33,028 --> 00:34:36,130
I suppose Mr. Gamble said it best, 

722
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:40,932
this is a legal arena, not a moral one.

723
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:43,908
The statement is allowed. 

724
00:34:43,908 --> 00:34:47,892
We’ll conference next Tuesday at 9:00 to set a trial date. 

725
00:34:47,892 --> 00:34:49,270
Adjourned.

726
00:35:19,332 --> 00:35:22,427
There's certainly been some surprises here today, 

727
00:35:22,427 --> 00:35:25,156
and watching Courtney Hansen on the stand…

728
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:27,506
Maybe she's got some denial issues 

729
00:35:27,506 --> 00:35:29,787
about what happened to her as a child,

730
00:35:29,787 --> 00:35:31,773
maybe it didn’t really happen.

731
00:35:31,773 --> 00:35:34,578
Obviously the prosecution wants you to believe 

732
00:35:34,578 --> 00:35:36,260
that she’s acting out of her anger 

733
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,800
against these older men she married.

734
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,755
It’s a theory.

735
00:35:38,755 --> 00:35:43,261
But at the end of the day, that’s all they have, 

736
00:35:43,261 --> 00:35:45,778
suspicion, jealousy, 

737
00:35:45,778 --> 00:35:47,836
innuendo, theory.

738
00:35:47,836 --> 00:35:49,677
There is no evidence to establish that 

739
00:35:49,677 --> 00:35:53,756
she purposely caused Jerry Hansen to have a heart attack.

740
00:35:53,756 --> 00:35:55,582
Suspicion? Yes. 

741
00:35:55,582 --> 00:35:57,960
But evidence? 

742
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,560
What is it?

743
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,555
Jerry Hansen told his son 

744
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:11,130
he was afraid the way she pushed him during intercourse.

745
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:15,410
And yes, we can consider the way her previous husbands died 

746
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:17,723
because it’s a pattern.

747
00:36:17,723 --> 00:36:20,917
Rich old men, death, 

748
00:36:21,757 --> 00:36:23,256
she inherits.

749
00:36:23,256 --> 00:36:25,266
If his father said he felt danger 

750
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,128
why did this loving son do nothing?

751
00:36:27,128 --> 00:36:29,762
If she gets convicted, he inherits everything.

752
00:36:29,762 --> 00:36:33,234
Why is this loving son suddenly making noise 

753
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:35,132
as the will goes to probate?

754
00:36:35,132 --> 00:36:39,839
She ground up that Viagra so he wouldn’t detect it, come on.

755
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,092
A man with a weak heart, two by passes, 

756
00:36:43,092 --> 00:36:46,230
she has intercourse for over an hour?

757
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:49,606
If that isn’t reckless disregard, 

758
00:36:49,606 --> 00:36:51,807
then what is?

759
00:36:51,807 --> 00:36:56,448
A man with a weak heart prone to pushing too hard has a coronary, 

760
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,698
they are charging murder.

761
00:36:57,698 --> 00:36:59,644
That’s out there to begin with, 

762
00:36:59,644 --> 00:37:04,215
To prove it, you better have some pretty strong evidence, 

763
00:37:04,215 --> 00:37:06,039
they don’t have any.

764
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:09,733
They are asking you to convict with suspicion.

765
00:37:09,733 --> 00:37:12,294
Why did she lie?

766
00:37:12,294 --> 00:37:14,162
If she’s innocent, 

767
00:37:14,162 --> 00:37:18,241
why didn’t she just take that stand and tell us the truth?

768
00:37:18,241 --> 00:37:20,293
But she didn’t do that, did she?

769
00:37:20,293 --> 00:37:22,024
She lied.

770
00:37:22,024 --> 00:37:25,960
Afraid you might get the right idea.

771
00:37:43,602 --> 00:37:44,944
Murder two?

772
00:37:44,944 --> 00:37:46,504
Chance of parole.

773
00:37:46,504 --> 00:37:49,519
If you get convicted of first degree, 

774
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,238
you go away forever.

775
00:37:55,433 --> 00:37:57,401
Do you think I'll be convicted?

776
00:37:57,401 --> 00:38:00,122
Strictly on the evidence you shouldn’t be, but... 

777
00:38:00,867 --> 00:38:03,976
I am not so sure the jury won’t look beyond the evidence.

778
00:38:03,976 --> 00:38:07,558
The insulin OD of your last husband, that'll hurt.

779
00:38:07,558 --> 00:38:09,988
Your lying on the stand, 

780
00:38:11,653 --> 00:38:13,764
that will hurt a lot.

781
00:38:13,764 --> 00:38:17,515
Bobby, I didn’t do it.

782
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:24,040
26 minutes.

783
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,767
They have a verdict?

784
00:38:26,831 --> 00:38:27,735
What does that mean?

785
00:38:27,735 --> 00:38:29,437
In this case I have no idea.

786
00:38:29,437 --> 00:38:32,385
They could have easily said no evidence or they...

787
00:38:32,385 --> 00:38:34,599
they could have just quickly concluded that you’re guilty, 

788
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:36,117
I have no idea.

789
00:38:36,117 --> 00:38:39,038
Well, if we’re gonna take the deal…

790
00:38:39,038 --> 00:38:41,036
Courtney, 

791
00:38:43,007 --> 00:38:44,622
it’s your call.

792
00:38:47,912 --> 00:38:50,276
I will take my chances.

793
00:39:09,459 --> 00:39:12,159
Courtney, the jury is not looking over here, 

794
00:39:12,634 --> 00:39:14,537
that’s a bad sign.

795
00:39:15,894 --> 00:39:18,320
If we can still get murder two…

796
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:33,154
They are not looking over, even one of them.

797
00:39:42,627 --> 00:39:44,395
Still on the table? 

798
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,487
Do rush you.

799
00:39:49,698 --> 00:39:51,242
Okay.

800
00:39:51,242 --> 00:39:52,540
Your Honour.

801
00:40:02,197 --> 00:40:05,170
We’ve reached a plea, murder in the second degree.

802
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,401
It’s too late, the jury has returned its verdict.

803
00:40:07,401 --> 00:40:09,628
It’s not too late. The verdict hasn’t been entered.

804
00:40:09,628 --> 00:40:11,820
We are about to enter it, counsel.

805
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:14,506
It’s not entered. We have a right to reach a plea.

806
00:40:14,506 --> 00:40:15,905
I'll file an interlocutory appeal, 

807
00:40:15,905 --> 00:40:17,986
we'll go upstairs and we will argue it.

808
00:40:19,171 --> 00:40:20,337
You really wanna do this?

809
00:40:20,337 --> 00:40:22,675
We’re fine with it. It will spare us an appeal.

810
00:40:22,675 --> 00:40:26,290
I don’t like this last minute stunts, Mr. Donnell.

811
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:29,603
It’s not a stunt, it’s a legitimate plea agreement.

812
00:40:32,019 --> 00:40:33,468
Mrs. Hansen.

813
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:41,278
Do you agree to plead guilty to murder in the second degree?

814
00:40:42,142 --> 00:40:43,976
I do, Your Honour.

815
00:40:43,976 --> 00:40:46,139
So entered.

816
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:48,254
Members of the jury, thank you for your service.

817
00:40:48,254 --> 00:40:49,446
This matter is adjourned.

818
00:40:49,446 --> 00:40:51,757
Sentencing 2 o’clock, Friday.

819
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:58,180
Mr. Donnell, I am not big on passing notes in class 

820
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,134
but you can keep this.

821
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,557
I think we did the right thing.

822
00:41:41,561 --> 00:41:43,768
